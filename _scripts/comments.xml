        <comment>AHH, I have the 5660 Sager with the Radeon 9000. I would love to get BSD loaded on this critter (even gentoo would be a nice thing) but have not been very lucky (or brave enough to unload, backup and do a full install and lose a week of productivity in the process). If you get bsd or linux loaded and everything works, I would love to know what some problems were with everything or if it was a easy deal (never in my lifetime). 



Thanks</comment>

        <comment>Don't let the Compaq 18XL380 die yet!!  Try this site for a repair.  I have no association with them but my 18XL390 did the same thing.  Sounds like a Compaq issue.

        <comment>In defense of the aforementioned girlfriend, (and yes I am indeed happy to see my title appear in print.  Sorry Ladies, he is TAKEN!!) Parents do not realize that in the moment they are turned around picking out peas from the grocery store self, their kid can fall four feet to the cement floor onto their newly formed skulls.  The type of brain injuries I see keep the body organs intact and perfect for transplant.  SO, if you are going to be so foolish as to ignore the seatbelts in the carts, please remember there are children in hospitals who can benefit from the organs of your precious child!  How many times have you heard,,"but I just turned around for a second....."  I hear it all the time as I am zipping up the body bags.  Thanks for the kidneys!</comment>

        <comment>Hi blog, 

I'm also considering buying a Sager, and I wonder, why did you choose the NP5660 over the NP8886?  Was it the weight or the screen resolution, or the price, or..?

Cheers,

Mae.</comment>

        <comment>I never really likes the 888x models. The keyboard was to far left for my taste and the keypad on the right side would drive me nuts. I wanted the 1600x1200 resolution, and the MP# player would've never gotten used. Plus the 5660 was the only one with the ATI M9000 at the time.</comment>

        <comment>Hello, 



    Chris - I had written you about this laptop.  Just got mine.  Hit 7056 on 3DMark2001SE compared to around 5000 with my Inspiron 8200 2 GHz-M with a GeForce4 440 card. Happy with the purchase.  The *only* thing is the viewing angle.  The enhanced UXGA on the Dell is much wider, so if you're doing Photoshop work full-screen images look more evenly lit on the Dell.  *But* the Sager stays bright when you use battery power vs. AC.  The Dell tones down the screen on battery power to save juice.  



I've just installed all the software...time to play... :) 



PS - For anyone thinking of getting a larger hard drive: the Sager uses a 9.5mm 40GB Toshiba drive.  IBM's 5400RPM 60GB drive is 12.5mm, so it won't fit the Sager's 9.5mm hard drive chassis.  I believe you can get a Toshiba 60GB that will fit, but it will run at the slower 4200rpm.  In other words, if you want 5400rpm, the largest drive you can get for the Sager at the moment is 40GB. 



Just a bit of trivia for those wanting more space....</comment>

        <comment>How's the keyboard feel on the Sager?  Dell Delicious or Molasses Mac?  Dare I hope for the keys light, yet springy, with that satisfying click to them?

        <comment>The keyboard is nice; similar to the Dell in feel, but not laid out exactly the same.  It's very springy.  The only thing I [personally] don't like about it is that the CTRL key is smaller than what you would find on the Dell. The Sager has a Fn (Function key) in addition to the CTRL key, whereas the Dell has one wide CTRL key in the same amount of space. 



So...if you're working in Photoshop, for example, or doing much copying-and-pasting, you have to be more precise on the Sager with your typing (or pinky) when using CTRL-V or CTRL-C.  I sometimes find myself hitting the "Fn" key when I want to be hitting the CTRL key. 



Pretty minor, but I thought I'd note it. 



Otherwise, a very nice keyboard.</comment>

        <comment>I have a few questions.  How much difference is there between the SXGA+ and the UXGA display.  What about adapters?  Did it come with a car/wall adapter?  How long did it take to charge the comp from 3% to 100% again?   



All information is appreciated.  



I'm planning on buying one for the wife on business trips. (strong enough for a man, but made for a woman... heh)

        <comment>Hello, 



I don't know how much Chris checks in here, so I'll give an answer. 



The laptop comes with a standard AC adapter that can be plugged into a wall. PowerNotebooks.com sells an auto inverter, but I'm going to guess it's the same as what you can get at Radio Shack. The only issue I've had with auto inverters is that I once had one that caused noise/feedback when I used it with my Dell laptop, but I don't know if this happens with other models. 



I have never timed it, but it usually takes a few hours to charge two onboard batteries from 50% (which is how much I normally use).  Using the 2nd modular bay for a spare battery should give you around 3 hours or so of use. In my personal experience, trying to charge the battery while using the laptop will result in longer charge times.  For example: I use the laptop for about an hour each morning on battery, then I plug it in when I get to work.  It takes most of the workday to bring two batteries back from 50% to 100% if the laptop is on and being used, but less time if the laptop is off. 



SCREEN:

This is truly personal preference. I don't like anything less than UXGA...although SXGA+ is decent.  The problem with UXGA is that font size is reduced, but the positive tradeoff is that you have a sharper screen. To deal with the decrease of the font size with the resolution increase, you can set your preferences in Windows and Explorer for larger fonts/larger icons.  You can also get a program called LiquidView from Portrait Displays which helps you quickly adjust your settings: 



&lt;a href="http://us.portrait.com/products/lv.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://us.portrait.com/products/lv.htm&lt;/a&gt;



You should also activate Cleartype: 



&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/default.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/default.htm&lt;/a&gt;



After doing those things, most text/resolution issues should be resolved.  Many application menus will still be small, but I [personally] have gotten used to it as a necessary evil to have the sharp screen.  



It's an ongoing conflict: 



higher resolution -&gt; smaller type -&gt; pixels less visible



lower resolution -&gt; bigger type -&gt; pixels more visible. 



I would strongly recommend previewing laptops at a local electronics store and comparing different native screen resolutions (XGA vs. SXGA vs. UXGA).</comment>

        <comment>I do check eventually. :-P

I've been busy getting the new DSL connection and servers squared away, and am currently fighting the USB2 drivers on this beast to get an external enclosure to work correctly. I'm getting the impression that the USB2 drivers and VIA chipset are worthless for anything other than mice on this Sager 5660. And in true Murphy fashion, the only FireWire calbe I have is the 6pin-6pin, and not the 6pin to lappy cable since the connector on the back is diferent. Go figure.</comment>

        <comment>Re: colors 



No, it just comes in the one color.  



Alienware comes in a variety of colors, but you spend $61 or more just for the new color. To be honest - I think they're kind of ugly, too...martian red and cyborg green look cool for about 10 minutes, but I think they'd get old pretty quick.  The Sager color scheme is kind of nice: a subdued metallic color. A soft blue/gray/silver color which will be nicer over time and not so trendy. *Although* I think the new Alienware irisescent "chameleon" color is kind of cool and a collector's item.</comment>

        <comment>To bo honest, I have no idea. Neither the supplied USB2 drivers on the CD-ROM that came with the lappy nor the ones downloaded from the Sager site would install...they would just sit there in the background after being double clicked.



What I ended up doing was expanding the xp*.cab file in the USB2 directory, and choosing Update Drivers within the decive manager for the VIA USBController.



The other part of my problem appreared to be the drivers that came with the USB/Firewire enclosure itself. Eventually I ended up deinstalling all USB stuffs under device manager, uninstalling the USB enclosure driver from Add/Remove programs, and letting XP refind everything. After that, everything was happy again.



I love technology. I never had any problems with USB mice or USB memory card readers. It was probably a driver vs. mass storage device drver issues.</comment>

        <comment>Hi!



I still haven't gotten a conclusive answer to this question. On Dell's Inspirons your able to for the most part upgrade the vid card, (barring any BIOS incompatibilities), The card slides into a sort of mini-AGP form factor slot. Is it the same situation on the Sager/Alienware 54m? or is the chip soldered right onto the main board? I'm asking this because this is of the bigger, (amongst many), factors I'm considering between the two for my next laptop purchase.

        <comment>You haven't gotten an answer and probably won't get an answer. 



First, Sager, Alienware and Dell all have the official line that video cards are not upgradeable.  A Dell technician *might* tell you that you can upgrade the video card yourself, but in doing so, you violate your warranty.  The only place I've found that even carries the video cards by themselves is on eBay, and my last attempt to purchase one fell-through after a month of the seller having $250 of my money. It isossible you could get one from a technician though...when I tried to get one directly from Dell, I spent 7 hours on the phone. 



Since opening up most laptop cases violates the warranty and there are few online technical guides for doing so, very few people will be willing to do it to answer your question. Sorry!  I've spent a lot of time looking for the same answer.</comment>

        <comment>Hi. I want to purchase a new laptop and the Sager sounds almost too good to be true! The problem for me is that I've never heard about it. I talked with the dealer that you purchased your notebook from and he said that they don't send Sager's in for reviews to many mags. because to get a good review, you neet to spend a lot of advertising dollars. I felt this sounded like a B.S. reason for a company not to have their units independently tested (except by LAPTOP mag that I never heard of, and if willing to let Laptop review them, why not the others??) This makes me hesitent to purchase their laptop. It seems they don't want an impartial review in a major magazine out there for the public to see. I saw you review and really appreciate it, but do you have any comment or concerns that they don't have send their laptops in for more  independent reviews? Makes me feel like they are trying to hide something that will look bad in a review??

P.S. I am NOT a tech. person. When I spend this kind of money, I just want to know that it is a quality machine. You hear a lot about Dell, Gateway, etc. both positive and negative. I've just never heard much about Sager at all! Very few people seem to have even HEARD about their product, (let alone reviews). Can you help me with this? I don't know how to use these posts very well, so if you can forward me an email directly, much appreicated. uniaxi@aol.com

Thank you so much!!!</comment>

        <comment>I'd never seen nor heard about the Sager laptops either, but I'll never go back to name brand. PErsonally, I don't believe any reviews done by mags; just ones by people who actually sepdn their own money on them, as well as Anandtech and Toms Hardware. Go to resellerratings.com and checkout the ratings for PowerNotebooks, Sager (the dealer, not the manufacturer/online retailer), Dell, Toshiba, etc.  Take note of the number of comments, their attitudes, good and bad, and the comapny ratings.



I am 100% confident I made the right purchase. It's the best lappy I've ever owned.</comment>

        <comment>I have been hearing that the memory used with Sager's chipset bottlenecks significantly and that the 2.8GHz does not make too much improvement.  Does anybody know if this is really the case?  I just ordered a 2.66GHz Sager Notebook based on this thought and if the 2.8GHz does indeed give a significant jump, I may just have to change my order.  Also, any thoughts as to whether or not Alienware's Area 51m is tweaked significantly enough to make a difference over a Sager with the same specs?  Thanks</comment>

        <comment>Hello, 



I've been trying to buy a more powerful notebook for the longest.  I came across Sager, but was hesitant in buying a power laptop from them, due to their inexpensive cost, like most, I felt Dell, IBM, and Gateway were the kings of quality.



After reading your experience/article, my mind was put at ease.  You really should get some sort of discount from the SagerNoteBook company for providing such a good review and detailed information about what you went through in purchasing your laptop.  



I will be ordering my laptop sometime this week - Thanks Again.  Hope Yours is in Excellent working order.  



-Carl

        <comment>Hi Chris, very nice review! I'd like to make a few comments and ask a couple of questions..  I bought a Sager 5620 back in October, just before they released the 5660. It was a P4 2.0 with the UXGA screen and the Radeon Mobility 7500 chipset. The performance was blazing fast, I played Jedi Outcast, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Madden 2003, and several other 3D intensive games at full frame rate without missing a beat, it would be perfect for a LAN party. It also ran Photoshop and 3DS Max perfectly. But, I was unhappy with the screen quality and I ended up returning it. The problem was that there were little 'waves' going horizontilly across the bottom of the screen. If you were looking at it straight on with a solid color screen (like a blank Notepad screen opened to fullscreen) it looked like it got darker and lighter across the bottom of the screen. If you looked a little from the side you could clearly see that the screen was waving in and out a little across the bottom. Sager sent me a replacement laptop and it had the exact same problem. Their tech support looked at some others on the line and determined that its a normal trait of those screens. Have you noticed anything like that on your 5660? The other thing I didn't like was that it doesn't have a serial port and I still have a couple of serial devices that I wanted to use with it. 



Incidentally, I had purchased mine from discountlaptops.com with a cashier's check and they were great, even when I requested a refund (which I promptly received). I would encourage anyone thinking about buying a Sager to take a look at them and talk to Matt there, you'll save quite a bit of money compared to the other Sager dealers. Mine did not have the Sager sticker/logo on it either. 



I've held off in purchasing another laptop since I returned the 5620, and now of course the Sager's have the ATI Radeon Mobility 9000 chipset and USB 2.0. Mmmmm. I'm considering getting an 8886, I'd like the larger screen and the numeric keypad, plus it has a serial port and 2 pc card slots, and even though it doesn't have dual battery capability it has a larger battery and when Laptop Magazine reviewed it it lasted about 2 1/2+ hours, which is not bad for a laptop that size. Someone else commented that they have never seen reviews for Sager laptops in any magazines.. there have been several reveiws for various models in Laptop Magazine, including the 8886 and the 5620 (I dont think I've seen one for the 5660 yet). Both of them got excellent reviews, the only drawback with both of them being size and weight. I am disappointed that cnet.com and zdnet.com haven't reveiwed any of the new Sagers, there's a couple of very old reviews on them, but those sites are 100% ad driven, and there's a ton of Dell, Toshiba, Compaq, HP, etc ads everywhere. I'll bet when you see a Sager ad on cnet.com you'll see reviews of the 5660 and the 8886. Keep your eye out for reviews of Alienware or Prostar laptops too, they're the same as Sagers. All of those companies buy the laptops from a company called Clevo (www.clevo.com.tw) and put their names on it, and in Alienware's case paint it a funky color and put a 5400 rpm hard drive in it. That explains why some people get their laptop with a company's logo on it and some dont. 



Sorry for rambling on.. if you've read this far can you (or anyone else with any model Sager laptop) let me know if you've experienced the same issues with the screen that I described? I may take a shot with the 8886, maybe my 5620 was part of a bad batch of screens, or maybe it only effects the 15" UXGA screens.

        <comment>Good info. I also, been looking at Sagar, but mostly been looking at Prostar, which has the same line of laptops as Sagar and same mailing address...go figure! 



My question is: If I buy a Sagar 5660 with a 2.4 processor (Im kind of cheap right now), would I be able to upgrade to the new 3.06 and also still have hyper threading? Thats of course after the warranty expires. Would I also be able to upgrade the video card? I work as a 3d artist.



Thanks,

        <comment>eg, 

To be honest, I don't know. The CPU is upgradeable, however the 2.8/3.0 has the 533 FSB. I think the others have a slower FSB. Not knowing much about the mobo, that's probably changable. As far as HyperThreading goes, the CPU would work, but HyperThreading probably won't work without BIOS support. I don't think there is any word yet on a BIOS update for HT.</comment>

        <comment>Howdy Folks!

I have a Clevo 5600P with a P4 1700 and want to upgrade the processor.I know that the main issue is over-heating. My current processor is the older 0.18 micron-256kb secondary cache model (socket 478) and I want to replace it with at least a 2.2G running on the 0.13 micron process.

Please advise if this is workable and will I need a bios upgrade as well?    -Thanks.</comment>

        <comment>Hello.

I have been shopping online for an Alienware Area-51m and surprisingly ran across Sager 5654 and Prostar 5660 which all seem identical to each other. 

Are there any differences in performance? I'm looking for the best gaming laptop possible. I'm also wondering if this laptop can handle sophisticated games like Warcraft3, Counterstrike, etc. at superb performance and flawless graphics. I would appreciate a fast response. Thank you !!!</comment>

        <comment>I found this a most excellent review; I've been looking into buying this model of notebook (from various manufacturers including Sager, Alienware, and VoodooPC) for a week or so now, and you answered almost all of my questions.  One additional query though:  when you say the battery life is about 1.5 hrs, is that for a single primary battery, or a single primary + a secondary battery in the floppy drive bay?  While that kind of battery life is probably as much as I'll ever need, I'm curious as to how far it can be pushed.  Is it possible to have a primary and secondary battery in, and when the primary runs out and it switches to secondary, pop out the primary and put in a replacement for even longer continuous battery time?  Thanks again for the info.</comment>

        <comment>PCTORQUE and WWW.SAGERFORUMS.COM

All the info you need!  Teardowns, etc, just like Chris said.

Also THE cheapest (www.pctorque.com) place to get a sager.  ANYWHERE.  You cannot find a lower price.



Anyway, the reason I'm putting this up again, PCTorque now has, through colorware, colors (duh) for the 5660 and 8886.  AND they're cheaper than Alienware.  Even the 'new' Chameleon color.  Colorware's even found out that Alienware uses a sub-standard procedure to put the color on.</comment>

        <comment>The batter life of 1.5 hours was for the single stock batter in the NP5660. I would assume that with the additional modular bay battery that time would be double; assuming they are the same rating.</comment>

        <comment>Define 'clicky'?  The only clicky-ness I had was the 5400 RPM  hard drive. There is an IBM tweak utility that will let you change parameters of the IDE chipset. One of the options has something to do with buffering/caching. Set it to realtime, and the hard drive chattyness went away.</comment>

        <comment>Great review , the kind that put you in the driver's seat and let you imagine ... let's buy that laptop , the 8886.



True and tested comments on UPS versus Fedex...both are great company. 



Living in Montreal Quebec, i look for a dealer in my area , any clue on this ?



Since all those machines come from the same factory , the great differences would be in the service.





Would you recommend a " Personalized System Recovery CD " ? or win XP pro offers the same type of recovery disaster ?</comment>

        <comment>Depends. Officially, if the copy was an OEM copy, it has to stay with the Dell, which I personally think is a crock. If it came as a resotre CD, it's useless.  If you got it in a seperate XP box, you should be fine.</comment>

        <comment>I have purchased 5 sagers and have an 8800 series and the 5660 with the 5400 hd,  the only problem i have had with both is one lit pixel on both,  one was red and after sever nasty call i got a rma #   I just got the 5660 and love it but have a lit blue pixel,  not as bad as the red,  but am tired of any,   i look at a pc all day and anything over 1800.00 i expect a good screen,   i picked it up and it was perfect, after the second day the blue dot of death appeared.   it doesnt bother me so i doubt if i bother with it untill more apprear.  Sager like all notebook companies are cautious and screen issues because of costs.  has anyone had a problem like this with a sager?   I have not had this problem in the other models..

        <comment>haha, left you a post on the 5660. I have the same brick with 1024 RAM, Radeon 9000, P4 2.8 cpu, etc, etc. 



Are you thinking of installing BSD or linux on the thing? Or have you tried to yet.. Just want to see if I can get feedback from someone with the same specs that I have. 



Also, you should try the Hydravision if you have not played with it yet. Works great on my box so far.

        <comment>I purchased a Sager two or so years ago.

I am happy with the computer, except for a few things:

1-The case is cheap, nothing solid like a Dell or other brand.

2-It overheats quickly



Recently my problem was the fan - it wouldn't come on. I ordered a replacement part, but assuming the replacement isn't defective, then perhaps that part of the motherboard is fried. Since the fan is kaput, the computer "beeps" incessantly and when the laptop gets hot enough it just shuts down. If I'm not sitting in a wind tunnel, this would be most likely 10 minutes.



Now I am looking into replacing the motherboard, rather than the entire laptop. Why? well, because I laid down about 3 G for this one two or so years ago (and it's just a P III 650mhz) and well, for what I'm doing, the speed is fine (No gaming here)



Since the laptop is larger then most (15.7") I suspect finding a motherboard maybe difficult.



Anyone out there know something about laptop motherboard replacement?</comment>

        <comment>Thanks for the great review.  I had been drooling over the alienware laptop for a long time but couldn't justify the outrageous cost.  I stumbled across the Sager 5660, and started looking for a good deal, when I found your review.  The only thing left to do was check my credit card available balance.  It is now on it's way.

        <comment>Hi. I , and I'm sure everyone here, would like to know the bottom line: What's the catch in buying a clevo notebook as opposed to an Alienware?  I am also thinking that maybe some of these reviews are just to make the Clevo notebooks look better.  I mean all of you discovered Clevo and then were skeptical about the price tag so in turn sought after reviews.  I may seem like a 'worry-wort' but I need to know exactly what I'm investing in.

        <comment>Regarding installing an alternate OS:  I have sucessfully installed Debian (GNU/Linux) on my Alienware Area-51m.  There are a LOT of things that don't work, however - won't resume from suspend/hibernate; none of the function keys or hot keys work; rocker pad doesn't work.  I admit that I'm a bit of a linux newbie with only a couple years of experience being away from MicroShaft, so I know that others are liekly to have more success than what I've seen.  There is a guy who has done a lot of work to get things working well with this hardware:



&lt;a href="http://cpbotha.net/clevo5600/clevo5600_linux/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://cpbotha.net/clevo5600/clevo5600_linux/&lt;/a&gt;



I plan to follow these instructions and see how well I can get my green alien working, but I'd love to hear of other peoples experiences with a non-MS OS.  I'm especially interested in seeing if anyone is successfully using FreeBSD.

        <comment>Great review. I just this week found out about these companies offerings in my exhaustive search for laptops that truly can take the place of desktops. The Sager's price is almost too good to be true considering the performance (Alienware's Area51-m is sweet, but at $600 more for a t-shirt and a nifty color doesn't seem to add up for me). One concern though, you had mentioned usb problems, any other Sager, Alien, Voodoo users have same problem? I have 3 external hdd's, ext cdr-rw, dvd-r, printers, mp3 player, get the idea. If the usb ports are iffy, then I would have to look elsewhere. Also, Alien offered a 802.11a &amp;amp; b chip in it's Area51-m. Having both chips in the same box and not having to take up the single pcmcia slot is a definite plus. Thanks.</comment>

        <comment>Regarding USB ports: To my knowledge, there are no reported hardware flaws in the USB ports installed on these systems; the problem is getting WinXP to recognize them as 2.0 ports instead of 1.1. The USB 2.0 drivers supplied by the manufacturers for the 5600Ds series of notebooks produced by Clevo Taiwan (also sold under the names Sager NP56xx, ProStar 5654/5600D, Alienware Area-51m in the U.S.) will not install correctly under WinXP. The reason is that the latest installer engine (v2.40) that comes with the driver bundle is buggy and, in my experience, will actually cease operation after unpacking the InstallShield data. I've seen only two working solutions for this up to now; one being what Chris had described earlier on: unpacking the XP drivers from the CAB archive and installing them manually. The second way is to find the driver bundle that comes with the previous version of the installer (v2.24 - see URL &lt;a href="http://www2.driverguide.com/cgi/download.cgi?uploads14/23187/VIA_USB2_Driver" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www2.driverguide.com/cgi/download.cgi?uploads14/23187/VIA_USB2_Driver&lt;/a&gt; Package_V224.zip). The versions of the actual drivers in this bundle are not different than the newest one, only the installer is different so you'll still be getting the latest drivers. Worked just fine for my ProStar5654...</comment>

        <comment>I recently purchased the Prostar 5654 after drooling at the alienware models.  Friend of mine bought the alienware system and now he is kicking himself for it.  They are the same models.



Performance wise the alienware system ran a little faster with some benchmarks, probably due to the fact of some tweaks.



Running Dark Age of Camelot and it looks beautiful.  I would highly recommend these laptops.



The one issue I have is that I have a Microsoft mini mouse in the USB port and it works fine.  But, when I reboot with the mouse in, I get the blue screen of death.  May either have to upgrade the USB or find a driver for the mouse.</comment>

        <comment>Great Review! Thanks.. Like everyone else I'm sitting here laughing because everything I'm reading I'm going through....down to the dying Compag Presario Power adapter...Thanks Again for clearing up alot of things...My one question is can Linux run on the 5660 at a 100% and if so can you have both Win/Linux installed and run at 100% also what is needed to do that? 

Thanks Again Chris!

        <comment>I have just ordered a Eurocom 888ES Dream Machine laptop for 3D CAD. Right after I placed the order, I came accross some extremely negative opinions about Eurocom (http://www.davidchun.com/eurocom.html)and I was seriously freaked out. However, most of the complaints seem to date back about 2-3 years. Now I have discovered that Sager, Alienware, Prostar, Eurocom etc. are all basically the same thing (Clevo). In fact, the specs and pictures of the Eurocom 888ES are exactly the same as the Sager NP8887 and the Clevo 888E. There is very little info on the Eurocom, but the Sager seems to be getting a lot of good reviews. Can anybody out there give me some comments on Eurocom and Sager/Clevo please?!?</comment>

        <comment>I bought an 888E and my brother bought an 888ES, know as an 8887 by Sager from Eurocom. We love the machines alot, they are great for games. My brother shows his off to everyone. Eurocom have been in Canada for a long long time and we bought ours because our parents have only ever bought from them. From everything I can see they are very good to deal with. My brother says that they are one of the biggest computer companies in the country. The sales reps are nice too.</comment>

        <comment>I'm getting ready to place my order fro the 8887.  The main reason I'm choosing it over the 5670 is because of the TV tuner in the 8887.   However, I've heard no reviews or comments on the Tuner.  Does anyone have a review they can post in relation to the tuner?   Also, how about the DVD-RW drive?  Anyone with feedback on that too?  Thanks for this site by the way!  Great info.</comment>

        <comment>In response to Todd's post, I have just read a review on the np8886 which has the exact same TV tuner. They said it was more of a novelty than anything. Check here: &lt;a href="http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.html?i=1775&amp;amp;p=1I" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.html?i=1775&amp;amp;p=1I&lt;/a&gt; was seriously considering that model because of the S-video INPUT. I am a gamer and would love to be able to plug my XBOX or PS2 into my laptop and have the best of both worlds. Console and PC gaming on the go. Mostly because I am sitting in IRAQ right now and it would be nice to have a laptop or console (or both) for entertainment. I deploy alot and am definately buying a laptop when I get home. Probably the 5670 though because the more I think about it I probably will only take the console or the laptop not both when I deploy. Its a great gaming laptop and a couple hundred $'s less than the 8886 and lighter too. It also had 128mb of video memory vs. 64mb on the 8886/7. So, inconclusion The 8886/7 has a poor TV tuner, less video memory, an MP3 player, which I will not use (already have one), a sony memory stick reader? I dont have any sony devices....You get the idea. Anyway sorry for the lenghty post. I get kind of ANALytical sometimes. Overall I think Sager makes great machines, it's just finding the one with the right features and price.    Hope this helps..</comment>

        <comment>from what i read in www.sagerforums.com, the main problem with sager notebooks is not the overheating, but rather 1) battery consumption and 2) lack of external battery supply. the amount of wattage this notebook eats is amazing. but if you're using it as a portable desktop, instead of a laptop, it should be fine. 



about overheating, it appears that some people have a problem with it, but these are isolated incidents caused by hardware defects. you shouldn't have any overheating problems. 



check out the distributer's policy on dead pixels. for poeple concerned with this problem, apparently most people don't have any dead pixel problems at all, just a few in a batch that get unlucky.</comment>

        <comment>Can anyone comment on the speaker/sound quality on the Clevo/SAGER/Alienware?  I'm interested in the Sager NP5680 and the information that has been posted so far has been great.  No comments on the sound though.  One thing I really love about the Toshiba laptops is their Harmon/Kardon speakers with built in sub woofer.  Anyone heard the Toshiba and able to make a camparison to the SAGER?  Thanks.</comment>

I went for the 60 gig 7200rpm hard drive and a 2nd Battery. This is my 2nd Pro-Star and am very pleased with the performance, My 1stPro-Star was a 2253.

I would recomend this as a professional peice of hardware.All of my Adobe apps work great and I have even played a few games with no problems.</comment>

        <comment>All of the notebook systems are made by Clevo(www.clevo.com.tw) a great manufacturing company for high end notebooks. No matter who you order from you are getting the same system. My advise is do some research and you will find the system your looking for for much cheaper. Make sure your getting the right model, ie. 5600P, 5600D, 5600DS(5600DS supports the new 3.2Ghz with 2mb cache) or 8880, 5800.. etc. many different models to choose from.</comment>

        <comment>Ok, the review looks great etc. I have owned only dell laptops. Some have been good , some not so good....here is my big question.



SUPPORT.... is there any type of next day on-site service? I, in all honesty, cannot afford to be without my laptop for more then a day. I will lose tons of money and customers.



I may have been fustrated with Dell's quality sometimes, and especially the tech support people I have talked to, but when a part needed to be replaced....it was there the next day with someone to fix it for me.



Anyone got any comments or suggestions?



Thanks

        <comment>I bought a used 8887 (still under warranty) a few weeks ago.  I got my first Sager in 1990.... a 33 lb. "lunchbox".



The 16" uxga screen on this P 2.4 with a gig of RAM is outstanding. And, no dead pixels.



It is so quiet that the first few days, I wondered if it was even running.  The fans are quiet, too.



I had several phone conversations with pctorque.com who originally sold this unit. I found them to be friendly and helpful, even though I was not their customer!



Hope this helps any of you who want a serious high powered system at a great price.</comment>

        <comment>Just a note....I purchased a Sager Notebook in 1999 and it died within 2 years.  Turned out the motherboard failed and when I called Sager they told me it wouldn't pay to get it fixed since it would cost me between $700 and $800 to replace the motherboard plus the cost of shipping the notebook to them.  I liked it while it was working....hope you have better luck than I did.  I wish I could find a replacemnt motherboard for it, but not knowing how the inside of computers work, I have no idea how to buy the correct one....oh well, such is life :)</comment>

        <comment>I used to be a dealer of Sager Notebooks at my store and they were an excellent laptop. I personally went thru 3 different models.  The only reason we quit selling them is because you run into so many people who say "I've never heard of them??"  You try to explain to them that these companies manufacture the laptops for ALL the big names like Dell and Compaq, but it flys right over their heads.



Glad people are finally figuring out that Sager is an excellent laptop.  If you want to know more about the LAPTOP INDUSTRIES "little secrets" goto the powernotebooks.com website.  They have a very good write up about it.



LOL I am going to have to get a new laptop pretty soon myself. I have gotten into the bad habit of falling asleep ever night weith my Dell Inspiron 8200 in my lap, and when I wake up in morning, it has always fallen about 3 feet to the ground! BAM!@!!  That reminds of one thing, my hat goes off to Dell (or I should say, the OEM manufacturer of this laptop), this laptop has been THRU EVERYTHING and you can pick it right up and burn a cd or whatever you need PERFECTLY.</comment>

        <comment>Ok, I just found this site by mistake trying to find some information about Linux on NP5600 series...I hope this might help somebody.

I bought my laptop from Mtech 2 years ago. I did some research before that and I reached the conclusion that Mtech, Prostar and Sager sell the same model, just the price is different. Before this one I had a Sager 3380 (if I remember well) which I know for sure that still works... and it was bought from Powernotebooks, many thanks to Donald!

Back to NP5600, it'a P4 2G, originally with 256 DDR, 20Gb, DVD, Floppy, 1400x1050 TFT. 

I have to mention that the notebook came from Prostar, confirming my thoughts about the manufacturers. I was pleased in the beginning, because the NP feels pretty sturdy. My happiness went away after about one month when I noticed some kind of flickering in the screen. I called Mtech customer service, and they told me to call Prostar, since they service both Prostar and Mtech.

After talking to somebody from Prostar, I decided to wait a little more to see what was happening. I watched the screen for almost a year and what bothered me the most was that sometimes when I was focused on something on the screen I could notice the flickering. It didn't happen all the time, just occasionally, and it was worse when I was moving the screen back and forth, but again, not all the time! 

As a computer technician I know that these kind of problems drive crazy everybody in the service!

In the meantime the latch broke, so I decided that it was time to call Prostar and send it there for repair. Another "little" thing was a label on the LCD, in the lower left corner, which was coming out more and more...

I have to mention that Prostar has a 72 hours repair policy. Well, on the website!

After the notebook got there I called Prostar again and talked to somebody, explaining him in detail what happens, when and what to look for. The guy seemed nice and we agreed to talk in 1-2 days. 

I called again in about 2 days and he told me that they couldn't notice anything wrong (that't how it always happens!) with the screen and that they need more time to figure out the problem. He also mentioned that they fixed the broken latch and removed the label from the screen. 

What could I say? "Ok, take your time and fix it!"

But here the nightmare starts. I call again in a few days, and talk to the same guy, and he starts asking me questions about what kind of flickering ,when, like he didn't understand what I told him probably three times before! The story is just halfway, and now it's very late, so I will continue tomorrow.</comment>

        <comment>This is the second part of the article that I posted last night.

I forgot to write that before I sent the computer to Prostar I had upgraded the harddrive to a bigger one. It might not seem a big deal, but actually it was a reason for the flickering in their oppinion! First they didn't want to take a look on the laptop, then finally they decided to do it, warning me that "next time" I should have the original configuration.

Anyway, after another week, I found out that they upgraded the Bios to the latest version and apparently somebody noticed a problem which they say it was corrected by reinstalling the video driver. I tried again to tell the guy that the movement of the screen back and forth makes it worse, and I suggested that somebody might losen the hinges a little, as they can put some stress on the screen. He said: "No, they can't be losen, that's how it comes from the factory. If you want put some WD40 on them!" Great answer, isn't it? I payed $1800 to put WD40 on it! 

After 1 month I finally got the laptop back. It stayed in the service 3 weeks! It worked fine for a week and after that it started doing exactly the same. Even worse, I noticed that the LCD cover was broken in the lower left corner and the screen was moving inside. Besides, they forgot to put the screw that holds the harddrive in place! 

I called them again, and after about 30 min I found out that the warranty expired and they cannot do anything. Although I had extended warranty, it is not covered by Prostar, but by Philips-Magnavox. They mailed me the harddrive screw though. 

I was so furious after the conversation, that I open the laptop completely, till the last screw. I didn't care about voiding the warranty, anyway it didn't really exist! And I opened even the hinges, which were rusty inside (how they got rusty, who knows!?). I cleaned them and put some grease on to prevent them from further rusting. 

The plastic frame around the screen was broken in the lower left corner, and also the cover had a little metal washer that went out from the plastic enclosure, and that's why the screw didn't hold in that corner. So, after checking the prices ($35 only for the frame), I decided to fix it myself. I put some strong Epoxy and after 24 hours I removed the extra with a Dremel tool. 

Since then, no broken corner, no flickering (maybe just once in a while, after the computer comes on from standby, which is normal).

Conclusion: I still like this laptop, because it's very powerful. The harddrive and DVD are Toshiba. It's all in one (floppy, hard, CD), not like Dell either with floppy or CD. The screen is Hitachi, I checked it. So, even though it's not brand name, the components are good quality. I can't say the same about the case, which is not even close to Toshiba or Dell. I opened hundreds of Toshiba and Dell, and I can clearly see the diference in quality...But, if you need a low(er) cost, powerful laptop, I think it's a good choice. Remember to treat it gently. If you need an extra memory, call Apacer directly, they will be more than happy to sell you a 512 Mb for about 100-110, not 160-180 at Prostar. If something else breaks. you don't have too many options: either service (which hopefully will be a better experience), or if it's out of warranty, just to buy the spare part (from Prostar or whoever sells it, because it's proprietary) and to ask somebody to change it. BTW, I have to knock in a wood, it still runs Ok, and it went through hard work: video encodings, 3D design, never let me down. 

I hope this will help somebody. Thanks for reading!</comment>

        <comment>Well, I must say that you guys have done a great job here. Just recently I decided to purchase a high end power laptop, I was initially looking at the high end sony's and toshiba tecra's. Little did I know that how expensive does not necessarily mean better quality. After, I realized this , i jumped on the internet and I have been doing research for the past two months. I was looking at spending like 2.5 my machine,and hey, if you speenfd that much you deserve to have a powerful machine. I never really know about sager or prostar, my roommates even got dells and tried to convince me to do the same. But anyways, I finally made my mind up, I'll be getting a 3.2Ghz HTT, IGig RAM , 80Gig HD,  DVD/RW/CD/RW combo, Internal Bluetooth, Internal wireless LAN, etc. and I intend to run dual OS, Red Hat Professional and Windows XP Pro.



Thanks guys for the reviews, keep up the good job.</comment>

w.Bloggar has made poisting just a little bit more bearable. That, in turn means more posts, more traffic, etc, yada, foo.</comment>

        <comment>Hi Christopher,



Thanks for the ping. Never seen your weblog before, but I like it so I was

wondering if you had an rdf- or xml-feed in there somewhere? I noticed

you're using MovableType so I assume you do, couldn't find it anywhere

though..



I would have sent this in an email to you instead, if I could find it anywhere.. ;-)</comment>

        <comment>No, actually I don't have any feeds. I never got around to making a template for MT since my site is already XML underneath, it should be easy.



Tell ya what, it's on the list tonight just for you. :-)</comment>

        <comment>First off; thanks Christopher. Can't say I'm surprised though, bloggers seem far more willing to get with the program than the average webdeveloper, maybe because our sites are more significant to us. We present content to be read and used, and returned to, daily. Regular webdevelopers have a portfolio..



Statistics do show that Netscape 4 have about 1% of users, but it's dying, and pretty fast too. Check out these stats; they rather obviously show that Netscape 4 is not a browser to support to the detriment of standards-compliant browsers:

        <comment>Dear Joe

  

   I'm a fan of Fearfactor and I think I have an idea for the show. I think you should have an episode with just kids. It would be for $1,000. If you have any comments you can contact me at Rstz3@aol.com.

    

                               Your friend

        <comment>You read other weblogs right? Well, I read plenty, I don't know exactly how many but atleast thirty. If I were to visit each one, every day, and keep track of wether I've read the latest post in each of them, I wouldn't be doing much anything else than reading weblogs.



I use a "newsreader", or "rss-aggregator", a handy application which subscribes to RSS-feeds and shows me the new/unread posts. That way I don't have to visit a site to know wether or not it has updated, or keep track of wether or not I've read the latest post.



Ain't that neat?</comment>

        <comment>Well if you like Bruce's singing talents you might want to check for one of his solo albums, too. During the time after he left the band (returned to Maiden officially in spring 1999) he worked on some pretty impressive "thunderous" metal albums. Go catch "Accident of Birth" and "The chemical wedding". I think even "Accident in Brazil" [live performance] might be worth a look.

Regarding Maiden's latest works, Bruce has not been in the band only for the albums "The X Factor" and "Virtual XI". Actually Bruce was not in the Band for only three studio albums: the 2 mentioned plus the debut "Iron Maiden" which featured Paul Di'Anno as lead vocals. The other two featured a guy called Blaze Bailey as vocals. Although X-Factor has some tracks influenced/written by Bruce, the band has in my opinion never reached its full potential and that "Iron Maiden touch" with Blaze. That might be the reason why he quit in end of 1998 and Bruce returned....

Would be glad to hear if you like the "solos" .

Yours,

Michael</comment>

        <comment>Thank Brad! I actually found it buried in the MT forums via Google.



So you're going with XHTML 1.1 huh? Brave. :-)

The only thing kicking my butt in XHTL 1.0 Strict is forms. The mind boggles at how comfortable everyone became with abusing them.



I spent an hour before I realized I have to put my input/select elements inside of a fieldset element inside of the form element. ;-/</comment>

        <comment>Indeed. So far so good. Should be easily skinable at this point.

The only snafu with validation was that the MovableType code was putting target attributes in anchor tag of author links, which is a no-no in XHTML Strict 1.0  :-(



Nothing a little quick editing didn't fix.</comment>

        <comment>Bold probably contributes to the properly capitalized titles looking weird. I think they look more like titles and less like sentence fragments with the capitals. Grammar be damned when clarity is the boss! You're supposed to have a certain amount of latitude with capitalization in titles or section names.</comment>

        <comment>I have a similar problem, ended up with a netfinity 5600 and a EXP15 enclosure, also 10 SCSI drives in the enclosure but only 2 in the internal drivebays. Now of cause I want to mirror the internal drives and do RAID 5 on the drives in the enclosure...



I chase a ISO boot image at ibm.com for a week(wtf mate!) and finally boot it of and I am presented with some Linux/X-Free based intefrace and two disks from the enclosure are missing, instead the disks from the internal bay show up... what is that about?



This is kryptonite, so I pull the plugg on the internal drive bay from the ServeRAID PCI card and plugg it in to the on-board scsi controller, now the enclosure reports to contain the drives that are actually there, but I cant see the internal drives, fair enough, there must be some other wigglet for configuring the on-board card BUT WHAT THE IS IT? is it a menu during POST or is it an application that you have to run from Ms Windows? 



If anyone knows anything that could help me out, please, or the poor netfinity will have to defy gravity, if but for a short while (4th floor into passengerseat of project managers car)</comment>

        <comment>Years ago, I too purchased an HP N series laptop back when they cost an arm and a leg but declined the extended warranty because I had always been taught that it was a rip-off, just additional income for the retailer, plus I had heard horror stories about repair at Best Buy. Well after about two years of hard travelling and a couple of drops, the unit wouldn't recharge the battery. So, I immeediately sent the unit to HP by FedEx. They arranged pickup and returned the unit with a new mobo and a new top which wasn't even an issue, but it had a small crack in it from one of the drops, in 3 DAYS for $289. The laptop is now 7-8 years old and still plugging away , albeit in a reduced role. Would I do it the same way again? Damn right! The Best Buy repair folks will never get their hands on my stuff.</comment>

        <comment>I purchased a Sony Vaio at best buy March 2002, I brought the Box in to best buy cause it wouldn't even boot up and if it did it would only stay on for 10-15 mins before locking up.  Wannabe comp geek behind the desk ask me if I performed a system restore, another freak told me it was probably over heating and the next overly happy cat told me it was the memory.  Feeling just great about the encounter I figured three heads are better than one right. Wrong!  They call me a week later and tell me they couldn't find anything wrong with it and to come pick it up.  I head down there and I ask them to boot it prior to me carting it back home.  So he attempts to and gets the black hole.  Great thanks for wasting my time right.  Well they tell me to come back in another week so they head tech can work on it.  (head tech) hmmmmmm...  After 2 weeks of no call and no nothing, I decided to swing on by.  Guy tells me they can't boot it, and it locks up in bios.  DUH!  isn't that what I brought it to you for, to fix it, not tell me what I told you when I brought the F'er in 3 weeks prior.  So the guy tells me they are sending it to sony and it should take about 2 weeks and hes shipping it off to them that day.  I go on vacation for 3 weeks come back home no calls from best buy.  So I head on in to best by again, and the guy tells me that sony just recieved the box the day prior.  So where did it sit for almost 3 weeks???  in a laundry basket under the best buy counter? Another week goes by no update from best by, phone there is always busy, so I head in again to see whats up.  Guy tells me sony is ordering parts, I ask him what parts, he tells me he does not know...  Well alrighty then....  2 more weeks go buy and still no word, I head in to best buy again, and stand in the cattle line...  The asswipe tells me the comp has been back for a few days.  I asked him why no one called he said they did.  I can't help but refrain myself from jumping over the counter and choking the SOB to death.  Yet I smile and ask what sony did? they replaced the motherboard and the processor he explains in a high pitched overly happy voice.  It was like fingers on a chalk board....    Basically a new box but why so damn long?  Now that I have it home I have discovered that the A drive does not work at all.  I wonder how long that will take to replace that at best buy...</comment>

        <comment>Glad I'm not alone.  I too grabbed an HP laptop from Best Bye on special. Shortly after HP warranty expires unit won't power up. No biggy, I have the BB exended warranty which, as I was told by billy blue shirt "covers everything".  The local store service guy also assured me work was covered.  Also asked if they could fix anything else for me free, remember "everything" is covered.  Off it goes to Chino (Pomona?) service ctr for repair.  4ish weeks later with no call backs I finally find the # for Service ctr and corner a tech who tells me nothing is covered due to 'incidental damage' Incidental who? I ask.  Right there in the no-existent waranty explanation brochure I recieved.  Brochure who? I ask. Sorry, entire warranty is void. No help from the other cutomer freindly mgrs at the service ctr.  They can however repair the non-warranty power cord/pin problem for a mere $1200!  I tell them to put it and themselves in a box and ship it back to my local BB outpost.  After no call back I vist local store to pick up unit and local geek tells me he can't understand, but the service ctr is GOD! And please $28.00 in shipping charges. I expressed my opinion in loud terms (no intercom necessary) and manny the mgr graciously agreed to waive the fees.  Sent 2 e-mails to BB but heard nothing. Haven't been back since.

BTW: many HP's do solder the power pin directly to the mother board.  Also the cord attaches directly adjacent to the heat vent. No wonder it fails in hot So Cal!  2 fixes; HP does direct: 3 major repairs about 2 weeks TAT for around $269. Easier - HP port replicator powers the unit apart from the power pin - $39 on line.</comment>

        <comment>I have a compaq laptop 1800T and the power jack has short circuit. I have taken apart the machine and found that the jack is soldered to mother board. Somebody suggested that I could buy a HP port replicator to work around the power jack. Any ideas?



Please send your suggestion to yliuaaa@yahoo.com.

        <comment>HAH, I was searching thru some stuff on Google.com and I found this article.  I had the same problem, but I manually installed the updates.  Actually it was Windows2000 SP3.  Only server for 50-60 users (file, print, Exchange, apps, etc...).  I worked around 30 hours straight.  Went to work at 9am, server went down at 9pm, and wasnt fully recovered till 2:30p the next day.  I recovered thru ' the recovery console, but I also had to do a recovery install.  During the recovery install 'beautiful' Windows Setup decide to do something wacky and just sit there after it decided what it was going to install (components section of install).  Ended up calling MS Tech Support.  When I asked him what was happening in the install he said he didn't know how Windows Setup worked. HAH.  His solution: 'Reinstall'.  THAT IS WHAT I JUST DID.  Ok, I am just rambling now, but I think you understand.  Oh, and Exchange had a whole different set of problems.  I would use Linux if it wasnt for Exchange Craptastic Server.</comment>

        <comment>The PM, when used for Perl User Groups, means Perl Mongers.



Speaking of which...  I wanted to let you know that I have recently started an Akron Perl Mongers group. Rubbercity Perl Mongers. I found your website while searching for Akron computer groups/programmers. Since you seem to be a big Perl fan, I wanted to let you know about the group.



there is no membership fee to join the group and we'll probably have 2 meetings a month, one technical and one social.



If you (or anyone you know) might be interested I have a brief site about the group at:

        <comment>Hi all.  I just wanted to say that I was watching the same Saturday Night Live rerun that was mentioned earlier-  the one about www.clownpenis.fart (except the date is September 21, 2003).  After the skit, I immediately entered the web address on my laptop, out of curiosity, and found this site.  It's nice to know that there are others out there with my weird curiosity and humor.  Sometimes I've wondered.  hee hee hee  Now, I am going to check out the authentic www.clownpenis.com.

        <comment>Start filing complaints everywhere you can find to file one. Did you pay for it with a credit card (more importantly, are you still paying on it)? If so you might be able to get them involved (unless of course you bought it on a Best Buy card). The Better Business Bureau can't do anything directly, but you can add to the probably already large list of complaints against them. And of course you should also call and write the corporate office of Best Buy and ream a few of them.</comment>

        <comment>I thought your first impulse regarding the manner in which you intend to deal with the chain of events that occured in February was a rather intelligent idea. It proved to be extremely effective when I had similar problems with Best Buy.(Now referred to by members of this house hold as "Best Try Frys")</comment>

        <comment>I agree that you have been treated wrongly, needless to say, one Best Buy store dosn't speak for the entire chain. I have had service plans and they are great about it. We all have to be patient. They will get it fixed eventually and I bet if we continue to be assertive yet reasonable, all our problems well be fixed! Thanks</comment>

        <comment>I think you are not alone in the big world of nasty service by Best Buy - I have got a 50inch Toshiba HDTV which stop working and called the idot help desk of Bestbuy and they informed me that it will take 1-2 weeks for somebody to come to your home to check it and further the service center has got 6-8 weeks of back log and cannot service, so that tell you my frustration that I cannot have TV for next 6-8 weeks(If I am lucky) and the GREAT PSP plan is just to suck money out of you and did not ensure you any service deadlines. Customer service sucks --dont give you any options to provide you temporary replacement so that you can watch TV for next 8 weeks and then they got nerves to tell me that you can stay without TV for next 8 weeks. I wish somebody somewhere look into them and do something.</comment>

        <comment>File a formal complaint like I did at &lt;a href="http:///www.bbb.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http:///www.bbb.com&lt;/a&gt; and have them investigated.



Everyone that has had a problem needs to, it's the only way they will stop getting away with it!

Also, contact &lt;a href="http://newsnet5.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://newsnet5.com&lt;/a&gt; go to consumers and consumer alert, troubleshooter and send them your info. like I did, we need to team up and see how they like it.</comment>

        <comment>D00d, I sent my laptop to bby for repair because it would lock up and not boot about 98% of the time. I tried to fix the problem for the longest time because(being a former in store service tech, later mobile audio tech) i knew it would take FOREVER to get it back and threaten national security if bby got their hands on MY LAPTOP!!! So after months of no progress, and more and more problems like pretty yellow lines across the LCD, i decided to forfeit and i walked into the mercy of the mighty tech bench at the local best buy with a white flag held high. After saying Hi to all the people I USED TO WORK WITH there I asked them if they had my laptop, welllll finally they did after a month, but thats expected return time. So it was nice to know that my PSP paid for a new LCD, a new hard drive, and anew DVD/CD burner. There it paid for itself right away, and i did NOT have to go through the manufacturer which whould have taken god knows how long.  But the bad news was, the latch that holds the laptop closed was broken when they replaced the screen.. =( whatever, didnt really care, and they added another sicker to my collection, but to my expectations THEY LOST MY #$%^#@^% POWER SUPPLY AND THE RESTORE CDS!!! OH GOD!!!, but i didnt really care for the restore CDs in the first place, but i would have thought they would have least used them to insall the operating system back on the laptop before they sent it too me in the even that they had to replace the hard drive, which had LINIX!!! on it... so instead of replacing the hard drive and running the restore CDs, they put DOS on there... oh yeah and it still doesnt power on, i have to put it on its side to start it, and if you bump it... it locks up. I would say its just karma because i was a service tech, but.. its not, because its not theyre fault at the store, they just record the information that you give them, and send it to the service center, the service center gets hundred of orders in every day. Some where between them "fixing" each and every order and them shipping stuff back to the RIGHT store... something paranormal seems to be occuring because from my experience from working there, this was exactly the experience that i was expecting, which cant be what bby wants. Because they WANT you to have a good experience with them so you will come back to spend more money and put circuit city out of business, its called their loyalty one scores. So each store tries to do thier best BUT something somewhere is sabbatoging thier system!! ITS A SHADOW BBY GOVT OR SOMETHING!! THEY PULL OVER THE TRUCKS AND RELEASE SWARMS OF NANO MACHINES TO SCREW YOUR STUFF UP!!! .... nooo wait a min.. that cant be true, maybe its the girl scouts..... ... . .. nope gotta be from bad order of operations... thats it, somewhere in there the guy who checks in the order and the guy who repairs it and send it back to the guy who ships it, they lose you things. (to ebay?) lol wellll im off topic.

ANYWAY one last point, is that all the while your stuff is getting fixed for free (under PSP) and your getting beter turn around time than the manufacturer, you are scoring big time everytime your stuff has to go off for repair.. its called the NO LEMON POLICY!!! Now in my case i am going to have to send my laptop in again to fix this weird on its side starting behavior. THIS will count for a second time that my laptop was SENT to the service center and had parts REPLACED OR REPAIRED, after its sent in to have parts REPLACED OR REPAIED THREE TIMES, and it is sent in a fourth time and it is confirmed that it needs to have parts REPLACED OR REPAIRED, then they call the regional district supervisor surgon generals secretary to get the number to the Seasonal Part Time Corporate No Lemon Authorization Specialist to get go codes and the activation keys for the NO LEMON POLICY, then they mail one key to your store and they turn them at the same time in thier inventory liquidation management software key interface in order to make you order go INSTANTLY from the service center to your store without any extra units floating around, and then there the store has succesfully been authorized and bleesed to give you a NEW COMPARABLE UNIT. Which in the event you have a computer..... your going to get something far better than you had because they dont keep OLD computers in stock. oh yeah, GIG `EM SOONERS err BEARS!!</comment>

        <comment>It sux that this has happent to u and apparently others grrrrrrrrr. And "former employee of bby", I got a kick of out your comments ROFLOL. I've purchased a few things from my local best buy and fortunately have not yet had any problems, phew.

However, I, like anyone else has made purchases even substantial ones and it turnt out to be crap and I had trouble getting repair, replacement or refund.

I really think that better organization, knowledgeable ppl and better working environments would help cut down on the amount of time it takes to get things done and done right.

I mean, if u have an 18 wheeler backing up to the door w\ things that need servicing and thats jus stuff that came in to the store Saturday and Sunday, and u have hm, maybe 5 ppl at the service center to work, one proly a manager, 2 r the receiver and shipper, that leaves u one qualified servicer and one trainee, hmm...not quite the ideal situation.

Furthermore, if the things that we buy or that r used (including replacement parts) werent such CRAP (that to your NAFTA CAFTA and beyond) then we wouldnt have to have month to year+ long headaches.

IN my opinion, its not just the fault of one business, one person or a handful, its a collective effort of greedy, moneygrubbing, lazy, dishonest, theiving scumbags driven by their selfish desires, rather than higher standards of quality and care for the whole.</comment>

        <comment>You people are morons!  First off...if you don't buy a service plan, you are at the mercy of the manufacturer.....their 1 year LIMITED warranty.  Manufacturer....there's something to think about.  Best Buy does NOT make the crap you buy.  You're lucky they offer a service plan to make your life easier......boneheads.  What would you do if your precious human error-made laptop broke and HP or EcrapMachines or Comcrap was the only company to go to???  I'll tell you....they would screw you past Wednesday to help you so you better be happy there's a company out there that will override the MANUFACTURERS CRAPPY 1YR WARRANTY!!!  Babies.  And learn how to spell too you spoiled brats!</comment>

        <comment>Motherfuckers make EVERY excuse in the book not to replace your stuff.  NEVER EVER buy an extended warranty.  I've gotten the runaround for the following items:



1.  laptop

2.  fridge

3.  wireless keyboard

4.  ipod

5.  television



FUCK THEM.  NEVER buy a warranty, it is a WASTE OF MONEY.  come to think of it, don't even buy from them...use amazon, newegg.com, officemax, staples, there are a ton of alternatives...</comment>

It took them over 10 different trys to find the right type that would work in the Compaq, thats when I decided to learn to do it myself.  Needless to say that was the last time they did upgrades for me.  Now I'm building my own computers...</comment>

        <comment>Sorry for the 2nd post but I was rereading and thought "duh"!  My friend just got a HP laptop and the power jack broke on that one too.  He took it back to Sams Club and just got his money back.  Sounds like this isn't a fluke.  I'm also betting they know more about the problem then they are leading you to believe.</comment>

        <comment>Best Buy blows... you should remind them of their 'lemon' clause... (it's been a while since I worked there, but I'm pretty sure I'm not imagining this...)  I swear there is a clause that says basically, "if it doesn't work, and 'repair' can't fix it, exchange"... 



The best thing would be, get ahold of someone in Customer Service, ya know the return/exchange counter.. and just say, "Look, I know your policy, but this is the third time this has had to come in for service, I know that you can send it back 'DEVO' and give me a new one, and you get compensated for that from the dealer, so how about we save time, and energy and do THAT this time, and then you don't have to loose a customer."



something to that effect.. but the term you want to throw in is "DEVO".. it doesn't take 'em anything to do it, and they don't loose any money.. Hell, a buddy of mine worked as a computer tech at best buy for a while, and he said they would occassionally have some RAM that wouldn't be working 100% so they would just fry it out with a power-supply, and then send it back Devo, and replace it with new stuff, mainly because it was EASIER, and more cost effective, because they weren't wasting all their time on something that had become hopeless.</comment>

        <comment>Call customer service huh. I wish. That's where I get really pissed. I've called corporate. I've called Customer Relatons. I get the same attitude. "Nothing I can do". "Take it back in". No one at the store, manager level, corporate, nor customer relations gives a shit.



I'm taking the short rope approach. They WILL screw up this repair somehow. They they will have no excuses on the 3rd time in 7 weeks.</comment>

        <comment>I just noticed your girlfriend's comments on the Big brainwashed box website, I can tell you once you got their service plan they could care less about you, I know because I  worked for them a while back. I think stories like this one are far too commonplace, the same thing happened to my sister a couple of years ago.  Hopefully best buy will learn, but I doubt they will.  I would check out Bestbuysux.org, they would understand your story a lot better and wouldn't have smoke blown up your rear by best buy employees who would never allow what happened to you and your girlfriend happen to you in thier store.</comment>

        <comment>Dear 'Anonymous',

You love BB so much, yet you won't even leave your email. Nice. Anonymous Coward says it all. Listen, BB couldn't fix a laptop in three tries. THREE fucking tries in 8 weeks. You claim BB has no control over that? Bullshit. Incompetent service techs are incompetent service techs no matter how you slice it. That has nothing to do with not making the product. Don't sell a 'service plan' if you can't service the hardware.</comment>

        <comment>yup, there is a no-lemon clause in the service plan. or perhaps you were just too lazy to read the contract on what you agreed to pay for and point it out to the tech or a manager?

        <comment>No-lemon clause doesn't kick in until after the 3rd repair on the same problem. That's no excuse for them soldering a power jack on the mobo the FIRST repair, and the sound not working on the SECOND attempt. 



Read the whole thing. THe tech were unwilling or unable to do anything, and the managers and corperate support were of no help either before the THIRD repair.</comment>

        <comment>Best Buy sucks and they could care less about you...  The only thing they really want is for you spend money like crazy on accessories and a service plan because of the profit.



If you purchase a service plan they find it ideal to never see you again, 100% profit in the pocket.  When you show up with a problem they BS and try to place the blame on the customer whenever possible.



I'm an exemployee from the tech service bench and I've seen it all.  



Don't dedicate yourself to this company, infact purchase something from them and buy no accessories... it hurts there numbers and gets them introuble internally.  ;)</comment>

        <comment>Gosh...my husband and I are sooo furious right now.  We bought a plasma t.v. from best buy just 6 months ago.  About a month ago, the controls started acting abnormal.  The the control pop up menus would not come on the screen, (like the volume bar that goes up and down, the menu screen that controls color, contrast, etc., and input menu, like antenna, video 1, 2, etc..)  So we put in a service request, since we got sucked into purchasing their service plan, which from past experience SUCKS!!! (From our computer not getting repaired/switched out, a vcr which never functioned properly and never got fixed til it finally died, etc...)  Sure enough, best buy's incompetence strikes once again....this service technician who supposedly is "manufacturer trained" off the bat asks me for the Toshiba manual...what the hell!!  So I asked him, aren't you familiar w/ the t.v.?  He says, "no".   Man, were we at his mercy from that time on....what am I to do...  So he checks it out, and he can't even find the damned serial number...and asked me to help him find it...  So he leaves from this first appt. and says he'll be back w/ the part which he will be ordering.  He is to ask his supervisor what part he will be needing to repair the t.v.  So he returns today, and to make a long story short, our plasma t.v. is now DEAD!  He obsiously DID NOT know what he was doing, cuz he kept communicating through walkie talkie to someone who seemed to be walking him through the repair.  An hour later, there was black screen and the plasma would not power up anymore.  Infuriated, I called the 888bestbuy number, and they had this "I don't care" attitude, and that we are supposed to let him come back with a whole mother board to repair what he has damaged!  What is up with that!!!  He damaged it, it's only right that they replace it with a new one!!  How do I know how much damage he did to the back, and who in their right mind would let him touch their t.v. again!!!!  Any suggestions...we are soooo exhausted in fury at this point....we now are in worst shape than before the tech arrived.  We have nooo t.v., just a black screen.  He sealed up the t.v. and was sooo quick to get out of my house, and did not even leave me any paper work or proof he was here!!!</comment>

        <comment>Better be careful with the new Toshiba you bought. I have the same laptop (from bestbuy) and after a month the small plastic piece in one of the USB ports broke off. Bestbuy wouldn't replace it and Toshiba is being bitchy about the manufacturer warranty. They're trying to blame it one user error when all that was done with the port was plug in a USB mouse and unplug it. So be warned.</comment>

        <comment>Awesome review on the Sager.



I'm looking at buying one myself soon (I finally sold my ancient Tecra 8100)...

The one thing that worries me is the battery life:

  - What kind of battery life do you get?

  - With one/two batteries?

  - What do you recommend?



Thanks,

        <comment>I've had the same power plug problem recently; I own a ProStar 5654 (basically the same notebook), and as much as i like it there is one fundamental flaw in the case design: the heat vents. instead of scattering multiple exhausts around the case, they've placed one huge vent on the left side toward the back, right next to the power supply jack. if you tend to run graphic-intensive applications or games, the graphics card (sits right below the WASD keys) tends to heat up (hence the need for a huge exhaust right next to it) and the hot air is pushed out with the help of two powerful intake fans positioned underneath the case. of course, everything that is close to the vent will heat up also (the power plug, in this case). I think this is what caused the casing to come loose in the first place...</comment>

        <comment>Hi,



     I have a Hypersonic Sonic Aviator GX6 laptop, which uses the same chassis as your Sagar from all apearances. My adapter was stolen yesterday (thank God I had the laptop with me, and it is safe) and I need a replacement. Where did you get your replacement? If it was direct from the company, can you give me a number I can call? Hypersonic gave me the number, 5600P-P, but they want $129, and I was hoping to find a place that could sell it to me more directly (not having to ship from the states) and charge me less. Thank you,

        <comment>I completely agree. But even if they do finally say they agree, the first time they can't figure out a way to do something using standards it will all go out the window in favor of browser specific hacks and bandwidth hogging (but really pretty) effects. 



Why can't the message being delivered be more important than how it is packaged. I am not saying sites shouldn't be attractive, just that on so many sites the actual content is lost in all the poor (but again, really pretty) design.</comment>

        <comment>Christopher,





Sorry to hear about your tragedy. I can't believe that you are under 30 and having back problems already?! It's a shame to see smart people get hurt due to simple neglect of the needs of their bodies.





I've been practicing and teaching yoga for over 12 years; it has saved me many of the problems I hear about from fellow developers. I hope this incident will encourage you to take up some form of exercise to reduce your chances of future problems!





Cheers!

        <comment>The postal service honestly doesn't give two hoots and a shit about its cutomers. How do I know this,I worked there for 2 years. If you make a complaint in person or via the 1-800 number you are marked. Belive me that your service will decline wether you know it or not. There are legal ways of disposing of mail without customers knowing it. It is referred to as killing mail, or endorsing mail. You can pretty much kill the mail if you dont like the way it looks. 

Don't take a rural carrier associate job either. They dont tell you that it will take up to 10 years of pure bullshit, and no benefits, before you might be able to apply for another position. I quit due to only getting one day a week of work. This doesn't cut it when you have a baby that has major medical problems. So Anyways I quit and have been given bad refernces from the P.O.. Well guess those asshole always have the last laugh.</comment>

        <comment>Holy cow, I had no idea anyone else was dealing with this garbage.  I just had my 2nd FS108 5V power supply blow out.  My 3rd FS108 has the 12V power supply and it's still chugging along happily.



I have no desire to spend more than $5 on a replacement PS since you can get a new 8 port switch for $5-10 these days.  Since this thing is in my "server closet" (aka garage) I'm thinking of cutting the tip off the cable and tapping the 5 volts from my server's power supply...</comment>

        <comment>In response to Todd's post, I have just read a review on the np8886 which has the exact same TV tuner. They said it was more of a novelty than anything. Check here: &lt;a href="http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.html?i=1775&amp;amp;p=1I" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.html?i=1775&amp;amp;p=1I&lt;/a&gt; was seriously considering that model because of the S-video INPUT. I am a gamer and would love to be able to plug my XBOX or PS2 into my laptop and have the best of both worlds. Console and PC gaming on the go. Mostly because I am sitting in IRAQ right now and it would be nice to have a laptop or console (or both) for entertainment. I deploy alot and am definately buying a laptop when I get home. Probably the 5670 though because the more I think about it I probably will only take the console or the laptop not both when I deploy. Its a great gaming laptop and a couple hundred $'s less than the 8886 and lighter too. It also had 128mb of video memory vs. 64mb on the 8886/7. So, inconclusion The 8886/7 has a poor TV tuner, less video memory, an MP3 player, which I will not use (already have one), a sony memory stick reader? I dont have any sony devices....You get the idea. Anyway sorry for the lenghty post. I get kind of ANALytical sometimes. Overall I think Sager makes great machines, it's just finding the one with the right features and price.   Hope this helps.</comment>

        <comment>While MS bashing is good fun, think about your complaints:



1) DVD.  Nearly everyone has a DVD-ROM.  Aside from that, the reason that they put it on a DVD ROM was so that they could ship 1 disc, not 5.  If they sent you 5 CD ROMs people would be bitching that they had to switch the CD 4 times, and saying stuff like "Bill you idiot, ever heard of a DVD??".



2) 1.5 GB.  Yea, it is too big, but a lot of what you are installing is the documentation, and extra tools.  You didn't HAVE to install this stuff, so how can you complain?  If you wanted 500 MB of documentation, you can't complain about having to wait while it installs that 500 MB right?



3) Their "trial" is probably different than what we think of as being a "trial".  If you wanted to save on buying VS.NET, you could just keep reinstalling the IDE every 50 days.  Maybe this argument is weak, I would have been pissed as hell too, just playing devils advocate.



Are there any other good IDEs for developing in .NET? (WebMatrix kinda sucks in comparsion).</comment>

The only system emails I've gotton so far are resource warnings; spammers trying to dictionary their way through @icantfocus.com to find valid users. I cut those off at 3 bad addresses.



The spam level has been the same.</comment>

        <comment>I must admit to a certain level of morbid fascination waiting for your next tale of warrantee/performance/customer service woe. I want to look away, but much like the guy on the other side of the highway, I must slow to watch. I can't help myself.



Seriously Chris, thank you for not only suffering your quota of difficulties, but apparently also mine. With the exception of my Cube's inability to properly eject disks, my technology and customer service woes are minimal.</comment>

        <comment>We were running into the infamous "timeout on buffer latch type 3" error and was caused by the autogrow in tempdb.  Apparently when SQL Server is getting hit pretty hard and tempdb is taking a timeout to auto-grow, SQL server shits its pants and times-out. This combined with the fact that tempdb shrinks down to its last set size after a restart, you'll hit this error pretty regularly after a SQL Server bounce.  (If tempdb auto-grow from a set 1GB to 10GB, after the restart tempdb will be 1GB again. - Just how gay is that?)



Anyway, we just manually set tempdb to a respectable level to resolve the problem.</comment>

        <comment>Indeed. Actually, that's the ironic part. With the VS6 of the past, it was definately an all or nothing proposition. You either excepted the garbage it tossed out and used ALL MS tools, or you used none of it.



With VS.NET, it's pretty flexible and plays nice with most non MS things.



If they would've only made those server controls cleaner and made a real effort to play the W3C HTML/XHTML/DOM standards game, I would sing it's praises as much as I could.



But alas, it's the same old routine. Good intentions in; Garbage out.</comment>

I don't remember this being the case in your previous build. Comments would immediately show, but TBs would only show that one had occurred, the actual TB information would wait until the next rebuild. Or am I misremembering?</comment>

        <comment>When I started blogging, I went with an extra layer of categorization via two different blogs -- Left Half and Right Half.  Now, though, I regret it because a lot of times, an entry "belongs" on both resulting in me having to double post (redundancy == bad).  I wish I would have done one "true" blog, and then added some magic URL parsing so that if you went to "/left" you only received technically-oriented entries; similarly, if one went to "/right" they would get the others.



One of these days, I am going to actually get around to consolidating the blogs...



Both ways work -- two blogs versus one blog with heavy usage of multiple categories for each entry + URL-fu.  I guess is just depends on the end result.  TMTOWTDI.</comment>

        <comment>Are you really trying to imply lawyers should be sensible or display practical intelligence or *gasp* not abuse the resources of others?



The truth according to me is that lawyers don't actually want anything ever really, truly, secure. They want things actionable so they can litigate, but they don't actually want them secure. That's why big disclaimers are used, but actual security is not. If everything was actually secure they would have no one to potentially sue. Of course I'm an admitted pessimist so my opinion might not necessarily reflect the opinion of management.</comment>

        <comment>Hi, i'am a .Net web developer with a MCAD certification.

First at all, the big difrences between IE and other browsers is that it supports every protocoll witch is available for javascript, vbscripts, old style codes, the new style codes(W3C), webforms, objects, applets and DOM refrences. The rest like ASP.NET/PHP and such kinda modules are part of the webserver. Plus microsoft also thinks about the people who don't understand all of this realy good and gives some reactions on code so that the programmer don't have to think verry difficult. Like when you give a window.location a parameter the site will directly refresh. This wasn't the real purpose because you need to give a location en write after that window.replace('url') and not reload because than your cache will not be read but refilled. It's a litle example on how microsoft wan;t to support everything so that you have a standard or you can call it a big pile of shit. But the most important thing is it works. And i can write a spyware program for mozzila, firefox or netscape with no problem, the only reason it doesn't happens is because of the amount of users.



So i don;t think that you can give IE a disrespect because it handles alot of rules in a time a otherbrowser would dream of.</comment>

        <comment>I moved to Myrtle Beach in April and I've been ordering Papa Johns Pizza.  I've had it delivered almost everytime, but today I called and they told me they don't deliver to my complex (River Landing) anymore.  I really enjoy the pizza but if I can't get it delivered I'll go to Pizza Hut cause they will.</comment>

        <comment>Don't call Papa John's if you want courteous service.  They were very unhelpful and rude today when I called to place an order to pick up.  There is competition and Pizza Hut, Cici's and others will be getting my business.</comment>

        <comment>We ordered a pizza and it came an hour and fifteen minutes later. When we got it, it was ice cold.  Tried to heat it up, was like cutting a board.  We paid good money for this pizza.  I want someone to contact us.

        <comment>I recently ordered a pizza from the Papa Johns on South Cobb Dr. in Smryna, Georgia.  And the manager Matthew was so rude to me. Me and my co-workers had ordered a pizza earlier that week and the man over the phone told me it would be 45 min. but it took almost an hour and a half and when it came it was cold and there wasn't any garlic sauce and the peppers where all dried up so they told me my next pizza would be on the house but the next week when I called Matt said I was lying and that they did not have my information in computer.  But that's okay cause I am now a loyal customer at Pizza Hut which I order from every week.</comment>

        <comment>Today, monday night, I called the Papa Johns on Greenback Ln and asked for the specials for a large 2 topping pizza and was quoted 14.52 delivered. When I received the pizza it came with a flyer that said I could have had a Monday Night Football Special for a 2 topping pizza plus a 2 liter of soda for 11.97. When I called to complain, the manager told me he couldn't quote me all the specials. I simlpy responded that he didn't quote me the least expensive special. He continued to argue with me and I hung up. I was so angry that I couldn't finish my pizza. I will never call Pappa Johns again!</comment>

        <comment>went to Papa Johns at *6th and Ditch Rd. to get a Pizza, as I left behind the store was the Manager[whos picture is on the wall] and two drivers drinking Beer. P8ulled a little way off and watched[ each had a second beer] but had to get home before my pizza got cold. These are drivers going into the neighborhood where my grandchildren play.Sooner or later they will get pulled over for DWI and get in the Indianapolis Star. According to the store hours there was still 2 and a half hours to go before they closed. Dont want anyone to loose ther job over this but are these drivers subject to periodic drug/alachol tests? Want to stay annomyous because I still want to get my Pizza there ,they do a great job.</comment>

        <comment>Papa John's in Bridgeport Ohio has friendly service.  Their delivery has been aa little slow recently, but  it's worth the wait!!  The oonly way for it to get better is for them to hire more drivers.  Other than that, Great Pizza!!</comment>

        <comment>Papa Johns kicks all sorts of ass.  If you are upset about your service, tuff go to an inferior pizza establishment.  It's hilarious to read what you fools write in here, "I got a cold pizza" They aren't going to go out of business.  Papa Johns rules.</comment>

        <comment>Call to order pizza at the Herbron &amp; Josey location in Carrollton, Tx and was informed that Papa John's no longer delivers pizza to my area of Carrollton, Tx.  If they don't service the area why do we continue to receive ads to call and purchase pizzas.  Little Ceasars, Pizza Hut, Pizza Inn and all the locals do a better job that Papa John's and their pizza is better.  don't try to order on line they still won't deiver south of Frankford Lane. they miss over half of Carrollton.  I never knew of a company that had more business than they needed.</comment>

        <comment>I have always enjoyed Papa Johns pizza,and have been dedicated to no other,but I guess all good things (so I thought) must come to an end.On January 25,2004 I placed a call to Papa Johns and was placed on hold for 15 minutes,only to be hung up on.Being a loyal customer I called back only to be hung up on again.Now I am a patient person,but this would be enough to make any customer rethink their dinner plans.So after much consideration I have decided that Papa Johns will nolonger be on my call list for my sons after game parties,karate get togethers,superbowl,and since I am a supervisor at a large warehouse(Zappos.com in case you were wondering)and have ALWAYS called you guys to help me feed my guys,you have lost a great contributor to your franchise dollar. My company ,like yours provides a service to millons of people all over America, and I nor anyone on my staff would ever treat a customer the way your Shepherdsville store has treated me. If you relay this message to your store manager in Shepherdsville (Troy) please let him know that some classes on customer relations should be a MUST do for the new year.</comment>

        <comment>I am not near as nice as my wife so here it is with no sugar,if you can handle it.Your manager at the Shepherdsville store is a little Pr**ck.My wife called on Sunday Jan.25,only to be put on hold for 15 min.,I was then hung up on! I have 17 years experience as a manager, and I can tell you that people like your manager Troy give buissness a bad name. Now you may not care ,but me and my wife run large companys,that often have the need for a service that you(up until 20 min. ago)provided.I'm sure Papa would want to bust somebodys ass for the way his patrons are being treated.Putting everything else aside,one customer is too many to lose.I sure hope when I am able to start my own company I make enogh profit that I can hire little as**oles like your Troy in Shepherdsville to run off all my loyal customers.Just so you know I've taken the liberty of disclosing the amount of money you will lose in the next 6 months being as that is how much me, my family,and our companies have spent in the last 6 months(2,265.43).Once loyal,now looking.</comment>

        <comment>Yesterday, we picked up our grand kids for the special long awaited weekend. Our income is lower now and we have to be careful. My wife saved a coupon from Papa Johns in order to get their favorite pizza that we usually do when we get to keep them. It is 2 mdeium pizzas with any topping for $13.99. When we picked them up they were $20.31. I was told by the smart talking girl. I asked for the manager as I could not afford the increase. He said the coupon which came in our paper was no good as he was not a corporate store and he did not HAVE to honor them. I told him I was going to try to contact the company and he said he did not care. I had to pay the price as the kids were expecting them. You have very good pizzas but ill trained employees. The paper in our small town should have said the Mooresville NC store does not accept these coupons. It would have saved us a lot of money and time. We are very disappointed in your company.

Thanks, Don Goodman</comment>

        <comment>The students next door to me ordered pizza from Papa John's. When it was delivered to them, the delivery boy, parked in my 'HANDICAPPED' parking space.  I phoned the local store and very nicely asked the manager to explain/ask deliverly people to refrain from using HANDICAPPED' spaces for pizza deliveries.  He told me "he didn't think deliverly persons using handicapped spaces was 'that big of a deal'and besides they were only using the space for 'a few minutes', so I should get over it".  

Not only does their product bite arse in my opinion, the management is rude and discourtious.  I will never do business with them again because of the lousy pizza, and now I suggest they are "BOYCOTTED" because of their attitude.  Handicapped people just like the temporarily abled, also eat!</comment>

        <comment>&lt;p&gt;Ive delivered pizzas for more than 6 yrs,first at Pizza Hut&lt;br /&gt;

and now at Papa Johns and I have heard the same complaints over and over again,but I'd like to tell you what it's like from our point of view and maybe you will&lt;br /&gt;

be as understanding of us, as we try very hard to be with you&lt;br /&gt;

Complaints about being put on hold for too long:you might want to consider the fact that there are only so many lines and so many people to answer them and if you call during the dinner rush then you will have to wait til we finish taking the order of the ones who called first&lt;br /&gt;

Of course ,it would go faster if they KNEW what they wanted to order beforehand,but that would be unreasonable, I suppose, since customers have to have the specials read over to them several times ,then they have to shout to the others in the background"What do you want on it"?(in our ear I might add) they come ba ck with can we get half this and half that--Yes Sir/Ma'am. Well, we want thus and so. so we type it all up and just when we think they are done, they change the whole order (even worse is when they call back 10-15 min later and change it all again--after it has been made and put in the oven,sometimes they change their minds after we have left the store with it) So,the reason you have to wait so long is because we have to take so much time with the first callers.You all seem to know exactly how long you are on hold,well then, how about seeing just how much time we have to spend on you when we take your order and you can't make up your mind.Oh and another thing---IT would be NICE if you KNEW where you lived!!I can't tell you how much time I waste trying to find someone who can't give directions to their own home, or don't tell us they have moved,not to mention those who have no number visible from the road at night,and could you PLEASE cut on some lights so we know someone is home?Our job is dangerous enough(we're ranked just behind  police and firemen on the list of most dangerous jobs)without having to walk up to houses with no lights on and the possibility we may be assaulted and robbed&lt;br /&gt;

Complaints about how long your delivery takes:&lt;br /&gt;

This is a 1st come 1st served business and if the customers before you take alot of time then yours will be later as a result.Answer the door(DON'T scream "Who the f*** is it?"--you called us!!) when we get there don't make us ring and knock repeatedly before you answer because you're busy on the phone or whatever and PLEASE have the common courtesy to set the phone down while we are conducting business,you're going to need both hands to take the pizza/wings/sodas and exchange money.And if you simply MUST run to the store/take shower,etc leave the money to pay with someone that is available&lt;br /&gt;

If you find it necessary to send your children to the door,make sure they are big enough to carry the HOT pizzas with out mishap,and if you want to tip,tell them how much&lt;br /&gt;

(some of you out there might want to know that the tips you set aside for us are going into your teens pockets,one girl even tried to get the tip money that was included on a check from me)Speaking of checks,please have your checkbook AND IDentification ready,don't have us stand there waiting while you run about your house and out to your car looking for it. WE ARE going to check your id--just like any other place you shop, so don't leave a check with your child or the babysitter,etc The same goes for Credit/Debit cards.YOU have to be there to show ID to prove you are who you say you are,for your own safety as well as for our own----if your checks or credit card were stolen, you'd expect us to catch that by checking ID,so don't yell and curse at us for asking for it.(and please return the pen I loaned you to write your check because you couldn't find one in your own house)&lt;br /&gt;

The faster I can finish our transaction,the faster I can deliver the next order.Remember that the next time you wonder what took us so long and don't add to the problem.Time is money in this business and we try our best to make our deliveries as fast as possible in order to make a decent living,so don't "gum up the works"by &lt;br /&gt;

taking more time than necessary to complete your order/delivery&lt;br /&gt;

When we tell you your order will be delivered in 45min-1 hr,listen to ALL we say,don't call back in 30-45 min wanting to know where your pizza is,you're wasting the time needed to take orders/make pizzas,etc and its not going to get it there any faster by&lt;br /&gt;

causing us to stop what we are doing to answer your irate phone call,plus you are tying up needed phone lines We KNOW you don't like to be on hold so think about the other customers you are causing to be kept on hold while we spend more  unecessary time on you&lt;br /&gt;

Just so you know,Screaming,cursing and threatening us&lt;br /&gt;

will not get your order there any faster either--   I admit we are not perfect,although we really do try our best, we do make mistakes,and if you have a LEGITIMATE complaint we will do all we can to rectify it,but there is no reason to call us every vulgarity you can think of,(you know we can't respond in kind so we make a good target when you have had a bad day,but would you like us to treat you that way at your workplace?)&lt;br /&gt;

Don't accuse US of being rude when we are NOT,simply &lt;br /&gt;

because you can't get your way and have free pizzas&lt;br /&gt;

when its not late or made incorrectly.There are many scam artist out there and they use this as the excuse whenever they can't get their food free any other way.&lt;br /&gt;

We could lose our jobs if this happens more than once,and unless you wish to be in court for slander,you might want to rethink your course of action--we do know your name and  where you live,so it would not be hard to have you charged with slander when you cost us our job(check with a lawyer if you don't believe me)&lt;br /&gt;

I can also guarantee that I can bring in a roomful of people(customers included) to vouch for my character and my ability to control myself under verbal assault&lt;br /&gt;

(I have been in the customer service business for over&lt;br /&gt;

30 yrs and believe me I've seen it all)&lt;br /&gt;

Treat us the way you want to be treated and we will do the same to you,and remember that you get more flies with sugar than you will with vinegar. And think about &lt;br /&gt;

how you would feel if your son or daughter(most phone people are high school students) was the one being subjected to such vulgar,vicious,and threatening&lt;br /&gt;

words.&lt;br /&gt;

(One man recently threatened to bring his chainsaw up to our store because he couldn't get his food for free when there was no reason to do so)Some of these teens have burst into tears after being attacked verbally on the phone by an irate customer,some have quit their jobs because the abuse was overwhelming to them(How would you like for your child to be treated in this manner? I KNOW I wouldn't!!)&lt;br /&gt;

By the way,we do a MILLION Dollars a year in sales at our store alone so threatening to take your business elsewhere just makes us laugh,especially since we KNOW you  WILL be calling back when you decide you want pizza for dinner and you don't want to leave your &lt;br /&gt;

house to get. There are only so many places that provide that service,for FREE I might add.(I'm NOT going get on the subject of people who "STIFF" us on tips when their order is FAST,HOT,PREPARED CORRECTLY  and delivered during snow/ice/rain storms,flooding or heatwaves despite the traffic/construction work/roadclosures/bridge outages or parades that we have to deal with in order to deliver your food.Don't insult us by telling us we shouldn't be out in such nasty weather and to drive carefully--you called us or we wouldn't be there) &lt;br /&gt;

--NOW, tip &amp; tip well--we deserve it for all we do  &lt;br /&gt;

to cater to your needs,take your abuse,save you time and aggravating traffic conditions, GAS usage and having to prepare your own food&lt;br /&gt;

Having vented my own anger now I would like to express my deepest thanks to those customers who treat us with respect and courtesy at all times(even if we have flubbed up) who greet us with a smile to match our own and appreciate all the hard work we do to provide them with the freshest,fastest,best made food we possibly can-----YOU are the customers who keep us coming back to work each day&lt;br /&gt;

THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART..........if there were only more like you......:))&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

        <comment>I feel you on this one.  I found this post while trying to find the phone# for MCI's bill department.  



I had MCI for log distance on my home phone for about a year.  When I moved my old roommate put the bill in his name 1 month before I moved.  We set it up so the last bill would still be in my name.  I received the last bill and paid it.  A mouth later I got another one for $13.  I thought I missed something and paid it sense the customer service reps where so positive that the bill was right.  I received a bill about a week later so I just assumed that it and the payment crossed in the mail.  The month after that I got another bill for the same phone (another $13 dollars and late charges).   I called my friend to see if he was getting billed by MCI too. He said that the he paid the last bill that was supposed to be sent to me sense it was only $13 and had been receiving (and paying) every month sense.  We called MCI and explained to them what was going on.  They cent me a check for $26 and said that it was all fixed.  

A year later I got a bill in the mail for $13. I called them and said that I was responsible for the charges (I haven't had MCI sense I moved).  I tried to tell the lady about the mix up that happened before and that MCI had sent me a check.  She said that I had to be lying because her computer should that no one and called about the account in two years.  She got an attitude so I asked to speak with her manager.  That got me put on hole for just under an hour, I timed it.  While I was on holed I noticed that the last 7 digits where the same as my old # the area code was wrong.  The manager talked right over me when she picked up.  When I got the chance to I tolled her that I never lived in a place with a 910 area code and I could prove it.  The manager said It's only $13 dollars, why don't I just pay it? I refused and tolled her that they would hear from a lawyer if it wasn't resolved that day.  I got put on holed again. They got every thing fixed after that; at least I thought they did.  It's been almost 2 years now and I just got a bill from a collocations agency for that same 910 #</comment>

        <comment>That's weird.  I have several web servers floating around CWRU that have self-signed certificates (I have an "all-SSL-all-of-the-time" policy with web application servers).  When I first visited them with Firebird, I was told that the certificate did not come from a trusted 3rd party; then, I was given the option to permanently install it.  I did, and I have not been bothered with certificate warnings since (from those servers).</comment>

        <comment>I think there's a difference there. Self-signed server SSL certs are ok, but the interface to import self-sign ed client-side certificates was missing.</comment>

        <comment>Actually Firebird does have a complete certificate manager, but it ain't obvious. Enter the following URL :



chrome://pippki/content/certManager.xul



I can't imagine why you couldn't figure it out :-)

        <comment>&lt;i&gt;"Shouldn't I be able to make backup copies of my discs and play them?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not 100% sure about what the law says in the US, but AFAIK, no, you can't. You can make backups of &lt;i&gt;data&lt;/i&gt; not &lt;i&gt;programs&lt;/i&gt;. It is illegal to make a copy of a program for personal use, while it is perfectly legal to do the same of a CD or DVD. Unless of course the US law deviates from the "standard".</comment>

        <comment>Hell yeah!



you are darn right with all of what you said there. I live in Germany and the industry leaders just got politicians to pass a new Europe-wide law which (a) allows you to do a backup copy of a legally purchased object (CD, Software, Book etc.) containing intellectual capital and (b) on the other hand makes you a criminal as long as you have to bypass any copy protection in the process of doing such a copy! Now think about this! So why bother about buying a CD or a game anyway? Even if I do so, I am treated like a fuckin criminal. And guess what? I do not like that. Conclusion: I must be really eager to have it to even buy it. And another thing: if it has a copy protection -- I do not buy it, see where you fuckin' lobbyists will get your money from, when consumation is going down the drain.

Only flaw in me thinking/ doing this way: there are about 50 million german citizens following the herd like dumb cattle, buying any commercialised shit available. Talking about niveau....

I am interested how this is gonna end (figure me as an outlaw rebel for CD protection cracking with an AK living hidden in the woods....? Guess I should step back on drugs ;)) )

Michael</comment>

        <comment>Hello.



Yes there are things we can do about it. We have collected your DNS information and have made contacts with your ISP to see if they correspond.



We do not smile upon illegal backing-up of our software. Our "Customer Service" team is on their way to your house, and if they find any backups, they're going to burn the fucker down.



Haha. We win again.</comment>

        <comment>If the 404 page clearly indicated that it was a "404: Page Not Found"; and then, had a clearly marked search field filled in the with the terms and a clearly marked "Search Result" area for those terms, that would least confusing and provide the searching functionality.</comment>

        <comment>Well, I think I answered my own question. While aqutomatic search results would be cool, I think it could be somewhat dangerous, since all 404 request would hit MT and the search routine. I imagine this could be bad in a mini-DoS sort of way.</comment>

        <comment>Yea I've had a similar problem. They moved over my domain name to a new account manager on a different website and changed my username and password. Yet now I don't have access to the email address listed as the adminstrative details of the domain name. So now I can't access my domain manager at all! I managed to get access to the email address listed on file for a month, and they sent the details there, but now since I am no longer hosting that domain I no longer have access to the email address. Thus, I remember my username/password but not the website in which I need to login to with my details.



Do you know what the new domain manager of register.com/partnereu might be?

        <comment>Same thing here. For some reason, Register moved one of the 37 domains I hold with them to the so called new account manager. No use for that, no need for that. 



Problem is I can't register new domains with register.com now, because they say (watch this) that since one of my domains was transferred to another system. Let me quote the message:



"Please be aware that some or all of your domain names have been moved to a new system. As a result, you can no longer purchase additional products on this account at this Web site. You will receive new Account Manager login instructions from the company that sold you those names. Meanwhile, you can click here to manage your domain names right now."



Since I'm not familiar with this new system, and already have 37 domains together under register.com's administration system I don't want to go there.



They leave me with no choice but to register with another registrar that I feel comfortably with.</comment>

        <comment>You think that's bad?  Here is the text of a message I sent to Register.com late last year.  Things may be better there now, I don't know.



"We are now into the 13th day of getting jerked around.  I again request access to the account I paid for.  I have made repeated requests by e-mail and by phone call.  The e-mails have been ignored, the phone calls have not been at all helpful and have been counterproductive. 



Let me reiterate &amp; summarize.  I registered 4 domain names in bulk with register.com.  A single charge of $140 was made tomy credit card.  These were all renewals of accounts with register.com.  For some reason 3 of the registered domain names were transferred to an entity whose legal name and business structure is unknown. One of the 4 domain names was retained by register.com.  This transfer was made without notice or request.



My host server changed IP addresses for its accounts.  I had to change the IP addresses for each of the domain names with the registrar so that the domain name would again point to physical location of the web server.



I accomplished this in a few minutes in my account atregister.com without human intervention for the domain name not transferred to Global Partnereu (GPN).  I changed it in a few minutes with human assistance at Network Solutions after I ironed out a stale e-mail address problem.  In 2 weeks I still have been unable to get access to my account at register.com's cut rate no frills entity.  I would caution anyone to be careful and avoid the same problems I faced in trying to get a very simple problem solved.  I started this process 2 weeks ago and I am no further ahead today than I was back then.



One of the problems with the storefront entity, partnereu, is that it has little technical phone support.  There is a webpage where you can send an e-mail, and there is a phone number with a recorded message that states that there is no telephone technical support.  It is strictly e-mail support.



My first e-mail requested access to my newly created partnereu account.  I stated that the register. com password did not work.  It was answered in a few days and it suggested I get access to the stale e-mail account on file.  They could send a new password to that e-mail address.  I answered it immediately asking if I could use a quick method of getting access similar to that used at register.com and network solutions.  I stressed the urgency of getting the account up&amp; running. This e-mail was ultimately answered 1 week later.



In the meantime I sent e-mails everyday telling them the urgency of getting my business back on-line.  It was very frustrating being ignored for a very simple problem and not being able to talk to a human.  In retrospect, the whole problem could have been solved by merely unlocking the account so that it reset to the default register.com password.  It was a 2 minute solution.



After several e-mails, I became frustrated and calledregister.com to have them help me out since they unilaterally transferred my account to their unresponsive no frills entity.  Register.com offered absolutely no help and gave me the impression that because I registered the domain names with their affiliate I was on my own to resolve it.



My e-mails to register.com had an auto-reply to contact the partnereu e-mail support group.  I reiterated my dilemma a few times by e-mail copying both register &amp; its affiliate telling them they both had responsibility for getting me access to the account so I could get my business up again. The response was always auto-reply from register pointing me to partnereu and dead silence from partnereu.



After several days of no response from partnereu and no access by phone, I tried to pressure register.com telephone support staff to help.  I tried to convince them that I had originally registered with them after responding to their request for renewal of the domain names.  They told me that the renewals were not technically with register but were sent by Global Partner Network (GPN)/register.com



I told them that I originally registered the domain names onthe register.com website and had renewed annually with register.com  They told me that this time GPN sent the renewal e-mails and I had really renewed with them.  I told them that I had an e-mail receipt from register.com.  Despite my paid receipt from register.com with no reference on it to any other entity, I was advised that internally it was a transaction with GPN/partnereu.  They were unwilling to give any assistance.



Each time I tried to call register.com I was transferred to the partnereu voice mail line stating that there was no technical support.  Several times I said to the register.com support staff, "no don't transfer me to the voice mail again".  They would put me on hold for a few minutes and say,"Ok I am going to transfer you to a human this time.  I always got transferred to the voice mail brushoff.



One of the register.com support staff tried to convince that my real problem was with Logika.  They had technically acted as the registrar and they would be in the best position toresolve this.  Even though I knew that Logika did not have my account, I called them.  They told me that they were not involved in the least.  They acted as a front end in the process not interfacing with the consumer.  The support guy there told me to look at whois.com where it clearly stated that the registrar was register.com.



After I waited on hold at register.com support line several times over the next few days, I heard the advertisement suggesting callers easily transfer their existing domain names to register.com.  I had one of my few original ideas. I said to the support guy that I had 3-4 domain names in an account with another registrar.  I wanted to know if I could transfer one of them to register.com.  After an enthusiastic 'yes' I gave him the name of my transferred partnereu domain name.  I figured it was worth another $35 to get my businessup &amp; running.  When i told him the domain name, he said it was already registered at register.com.  Despite it being at entity partnereu I could not transfer it back.  It was locked.



On one call to register.com I found a helpful lady who fetched a helpful GPN support guy instead of the usual transfer to limbo or expression of sympathy at my having registered with another registrar.  After verifying my identity the staff person emailed me a password &amp; username to access the partnereu account.  The password did not work. The staff person declined to give me his name &amp; phone number because he was temporarily helping the GPN staff &amp; probably couldn't be reached again.  



I sent an immediate e-mail and called partnereu billing inquiry line.  I told them I had just spoken to a person who sent me a bad password.  I asked to speak to him so I could get another one.  Unfortunately, partnereu does not have 24/7help like register.com so I had to wait until the next day. I asked the billing person to please put a written note on the guy's desk to reset the account &amp; e-mail me a newpassword.  The next day I got the same password a second timeand it did not work either.  The average wait time on all myphone calls was 15 minutes; the longest was 35 minutes.



I received a phone call on Friday from a register.com employee who said he was a supervisor.  I called back &amp; let it ring 10 times without getting any voice mail.  I called Saturday, this time I was able to leave a phone message.  I checked to see if maybe this guy would be helpful and have e-mailed me a password, or reset my account so it would be up &amp;  running for the weekend.  No such luck.



I sit here on my 13th day of great customer support waiting for the 2 minutes of assistance I need to get my business up &amp; running.  I have spent over 10 hours during this time just trying to get access to the account that was transferred for me."



I am having my accounts transfered to another registrar for 1/2 of the cost this year.</comment>

        <comment>Interesting.  Under linux I run a program (well, actually a shell script) called 'abcde' (A Better CD Encoder) which takes a couple of args (-N -x IIRC) that simply auto-rips a cd to ogg and ejects the CD.  Re-insert new cd, hit uparrow+enter and repeat.  Or GRIP which will auto-rip on CD insertion and eject, so all you do is pop in CD after CD and close the drive when it pops out.



And it will do it into whatever format I want, ogg, mp3, wav, flaac, etc.  No DRM, no propriatory crap.



Maybe the quality of rippers under windows sucks badly compared to a shell script. Sad, but hey, as a monopoly MS can give you anything they want right?  Choice doesn't matter. 



Oh, and I think the reasons to hate WMP9 includes that whole "privacy" thing, and the propriatory nature of it all :)</comment>

        <comment>Well, it's all situational really. You can run the MT CGIs one of two ways: as the Apache user/group (www), or as a specifi or logged on user. If you run MT under the www account, Apache needs write access to generate your web files when you add a post, and when someone adds a comment. I'm no to fond of that.



So I decided to run the CGIs under my account via suExec. While this means all new entries write files as me and Apache doesn't need write access, it also means comments no longer work because Apache doesn't have write access.



I installed a set of patches from Sean Willson (http://www.seanwillson.com/archives/2003/04/27/000501/) that allowed me to turn off index rebuilds when comments are posted. I also hacked the MT::App::Comments and MT::App::Trackback modules to not rebuild entries when comment are posted.



I then installed mt-rebuild (http://mt-plugins.org/archives/mini/mtrebuild.php) and set up my crontab to schedule rebuilds of the index page and entries to display any new comments.</comment>

        <comment>Whoa... just encountered something funny when posting that comment.  On the comment preview page, the text-box where you enter/edit the text of comments explodes to twice as wide overwriting the navaigational links on the right.

        <comment>Hi,



I just wondered if you would know what to do to make IE/Explorer start as a new thread without using TweakUI. I guess it's something somewhere in the registry. 

Pretty bad that Microshred still forces an experienced user/sysop to handle even basic enhancements via the registry instead of just setting them as default.

Yours,

Mike</comment>

Thomas was the Director of Online Information Services at Management Recruiters International back in the mid to late 90's.



I interviewed there for a webmaster/programmer position either after I graduated college or after my first job ended (also in Cleveland).



Finally. That was going to bug me for a while.</comment>

        <comment>THANKS for your help.  Am just starting with Perl have written unix scripts in the past.



The eclipse/perl addin from Jochen Luell works just fine and your config to get eclipse to run it works just fine.



Now, I need to learn how to create .pm vs .pl files so a main routine can call a subroutine....



Thanks again!

        <comment>An easier solution is to only indicate in "Location" the path to perl (/usr/bin/perl for ex.). Anything in "working directory" and as "arguments" write:  -w ${resource_loc}

        <comment>True, it is easier, but I've had problems in the past (at least on Windows) where the current working directory and @INC is based on where you're running perl from, and not where the script itself resides due to using the full script path. Usualy this was a problem when trying to develop CPAN modules and test them in the local ./lib or ./blib directory.



Plus, (and maybe I need to create an extended example), using cmd.exe instead allows me to prepend additional commands that perform make clean and make before I run the actual Perl script in question.</comment>

I'm just starting to play with eclipse and was wondering how to do just this... now I know.



I also use an editor called crisp and it has a nice way to keep a library of code snips easily available to paste into my code.  Are you aware of anything like that for eclipse... 



I write a lot of perl and find myself just pasting previous chunks together.  Yes I use modules but you still need the supporting code around the modules to make it all work.



Thanks again for this web page...</comment>

        <comment>Hi, and thanks for the quickstart.  I have a bunch of perl that runs with command line args that change all the time ... is there some way to get a pop-up to accept my command line paramenters without having to update my external tools configuration?

On windows however, you need to change drive first if Eclipse (F:) and the perl application (G:) aren't on the same drive.

I did this by putting changing the arguments to:



/C "g: &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd  ${container_loc} &amp;amp;&amp;amp; perl -w ${resource_name}"</comment>

        <comment>Hi,

I have just tried the C:\Perl\bin approach before visiting here, and found that both come up to same conclusion. However there is a problem, the strings you print during program execution are not diplayed on console window (on Eclipse) until the program is terminated (run to end). So, if the pl script continuously reads stuff from STDIN, you cannot see the printouts. Is there a solution? I would be gratefule if you can mail me, or at least post here any ideas. Thank you.

        <comment>Great stuff. 



I just finished solving the problem of switching drives that other people have already solved and posted. 

Unfortunately, I only found the solution after I knew what it was. So, for the benefit of the next person to run into this, I am posting the error message and symptom along with the fix.



Can't open perl script



If you get this it may be that you need to specify your drive letter. Please see previous messages with solution.</comment>

        <comment>I'm on linux. This works great. The only point I'd like to add is that to use Erick's solution (2nd message posted). Make sure to include your workspace path in the "Perl Include Path". 



1. right-click on the perl project folder you're using

2. go to properties

3. add the current directory to the include paths



My script wasn't working until I made this change.</comment>

Can anybody please tell me if this EPIC plugin is compatible with Eclipse 2.0? I downloaded the zip and unzipped it in the Eclipse/plugins folder. But my Eclipse did not recognise any .pl files.



Are there any specific steps for installation?

        <comment>Hi Pratul,



EPIC will not work with Eclipse 2.0.

You'll have to use 2.1 to get it working.

        <comment>You can specify arguments by including one of the Eclipse-supplied variables on your command line.  If you use "${string_prompt}", Eclipse will pop up a dialog when you Run; "${file_prompt}" will pop up a file selection box.  You can enter multiple arguments in one string_prompt...



Unfortunately, 3.0M7 is a bit stoopid, and right after the argument dialog pops up, it pops up a small yellow banner-ish thing at the bottom of the main eclipse window, which submerges the argument dialog under the window (so you have to alt-tab back to it).  Annoying, but minor.</comment>

        <comment>when running a perl script on windows XP using your configuration i had the folowing error

"Can't open perl script : No such file or directory", the solution to this error is to change the parameter option on the external tools to   /C "cd ${container_loc} &amp;amp;&amp;amp; perl -w ${container_loc}\${resource_name}"  as the CD didn't do it for me. I hope this helps others that might had the same problem. Thanks for your article wich was very helpfull to me. Regards</comment>

        <comment>I cannot not make arguments work (my arguments contain blanks!).



/C "cd ${container_loc} &amp;&amp; perl -w ${resource_name} ${container_loc}\input.txt" 



I want to pass ${container_loc}\input.txt as an argument, but the path ${container_loc} contains blanks (C:\Documents and Settings\...). Perl receives only the partial string "C:\Documents" and cannot find my input.txt file.



I also tried this /C "cd ${container_loc} &amp;&amp; perl -w ${resource_name}" "${container_loc}/input.txt" but it doesn't help.

        <comment>Eclipse on wxp here:



/C "cd /D ${container_loc} &amp;&amp; perl -w ${resource_name} ${string_prompt}"



with $|=1 in the perl script does the magic.



Not my idea of course, extracted from the comments...</comment>

        <comment>Hello,



Great article sir.It was very helpful.

I am trying to run perl script which takes multiple files as command line argument &amp;amp; process those files.

So can anybody please tell me the variable which opens window exactly like when we use ${string_prompt} variable, but where can I choose folders or multiple files.



Thanks,

        <comment>Another tip for Linux / BSD / Solaris / OS X:



Some users may have problems seeing output from certain scripts.  To fix it, you must redirect the output to stdout, like so:



-w ${resource_loc} &amp;&gt;1



Note the "&amp;&gt;1".  This should go in the arguments section.</comment>

        <comment>&lt;p&gt;Very helpful. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2 questions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is there any way to do basically the same thing but launching into the Eclipse/Epic debugger?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is there any way to add the non-buffering of stderr ($|=1;) to the arguments so I don't have to put it in every file?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

        <comment>&lt;p&gt;&gt;wobd said:&lt;br /&gt;

&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&gt;Some hints for those using mac os X:&lt;br /&gt;

&gt;Location: /usr/bin/perl&lt;br /&gt;

&gt;Working Directory: ${workspace_loc:/project_name}&lt;br /&gt;

&gt;Arguments: -w ${resource_loc}&lt;br /&gt;

&gt;runs well with your . in @INC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some small notes on what wobd said above for configuring EPIC on Macintosh OSX:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;- My Working Directory did not work as given above, &amp; then I slightly modified it to be ${workspace_loc}/${project_name}&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;- I assigned my Eclipse workspace directory to a directory other than the default &amp; it turned out that Eclipse/Perl did not like spaces in any directory names in the path to the one I chose. I farted around a bit to see if there was an obvious way to correct this, didn't find any, and then just replaced spaces in my directory names with underscores. Hork!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

        <comment>I've used EPIC on Windows for at least a year and have been quite happy. But recently I've had to do some work on a Mac and the configuration there is driving me nuts.



No matter what I do when setting variables my arguments are always prepended with whatever variable is selected in the variable list. I don't want any of them but can't find a way to choose none. Because I can't every attempt to run "perl -w" fails with an error regarding "${build_project} -w ${resource_loc}", or "{some_other_unwanted_variable} -w ${resource_loc}".



Please help me before I just give up on EPIC on the Mac.:-)</comment>

        <comment>Hello,

I'm running on Windows XP.

Try the following if you have "cd" problem.



Location : C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe

Working Directory : ${container_loc}

Arguments : /C "perl -w ${resource_name}"



Test environment is

Eclipse 3.1

c:\perl

d:\work\eclipse\testperl\test1.pl</comment>

        <comment>Ya know, you have me curious. A quick googling for ["headers only" Thunderbird] yields nothing, not even discussions about it.



I remember, when I used Mozilla Mail that it never downloaded the full messages unless junk controls were on (because it needed to calc the whole message, not just headers). So, I wonder if the default is the do headers only for IMAP accounts?</comment>

        <comment>Id like to know how I can configure multiple accounts using the same SMTP server...



Example:

I have 5 acounts hosted @formatur.com.br



Each time I need to send a email, I need to send it by the same server (smtp.formatur.com.br) BUT I need to log on the server with the account name and its respective password.



And it goes like this:



cgracio@formatur.com.br

smtp.formatur.com.br

pwd: XXXXX



convites@formatur.com.br

smtp.formatur.com.br

pwd: YYYYY



formatur@formatur.com.br

smtp.formatur.com.br

pwd: ZZZZZ



Sorry `bout the poor english, I`m brazilian!

Tks to everyone who could help me!</comment>

        <comment>I have multiple SMTP servers added under the Advanced tab, but when I switch between trying to send email at home or at school (diff SMTP servers), Thunderbird seems to only look at which one is listed on top.  Is there a place where I tell it to try the next one down if the first one doesn't work?  I found out how to designate which server my differnet accounts should use, but I use both email accounts at both locations.</comment>

        <comment>Found the problem. The P3-S 1.4 has no L2 cache. The old P4 1.0 had 256k L2. Guess it makes a difference.</comment>

        <comment>After the BIOS upgrade, the "external cache" (L2) option was set to "Disabled". How stupid. Resetting it to "Write-Back" solved my problems and now everything is zipping along nicely.</comment>

        <comment>Yes, but instead the recording companies keep their prices sky high, and spend their time and money on dragging 12-year-olds into court.



Dave Matthews was also a major supporter of Napster. There is obviously no love lost between him and the recording companies.



This is a great looking site!</comment>

        <comment>All right, I can't look too closely at it right now... maybe later; but the regex spooked me.



s/\s*(.*?)\s*/$1/;



I doubt that will does what you want.  You might want to split that into two:



s/^\s+//;s/\s+$//;



Take a look at the following:

-------------------------------

my @strings;



push @strings, 'nospace';

push @strings, 'trailingspace      ';

push @strings, '      leadingspace';

push @strings, 'internal space';



for(@strings)

{

	print "Before: '$_'\n";

	s/\s*(.*?)\s*/$1/;

	print "After: '$_'\n\n\n";

}



Outputs:

Before: 'nospace'

After: 'nospace'





Before: 'trailingspace      '

After: 'trailingspace      '





Before: '      leadingspace'

After: 'leadingspace'





Before: 'internal space'

After: 'internal space'</comment>

        <comment>Actually, I stole the foreach loop code directly from CGI::Cookies' raw_fetch sub.



Since the target server doesn't have Apache::Cookie installed, and the stock 5.6.1 CGI::Cookie is borked under mod_perl, I just ripped the code to make it slim.



Seems to work as intended.



On the formatting side, I'm thinking about revamping the layout again so we can use 100% of the page width in code samples.</comment>

        <comment>I was shocked... *shocked* to find such a regex in CGI::Cookie.  So, just to make sure I was not going crazy, I conferred with my monkish brethren (http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=299587).  That regex is, indeed, broken.  I am submitting  a patch.  Just goes to show, even the better programmers slip up time-to-time.</comment>

        <comment>&gt;  Wouldn't s/^\s*(\S.*?)\s*$/$1/; work



Yes, it would; but it is doing too much.  On the first part, why match on 0 spaces?  On the end, why match on 0 spaces?  At the very least, change those to + signs a la: s/^\s+(\S.*?)\s+$/$1/;.  Even then, why match 1 or more spaces, then match on a non-space?  Of course that is going to happen or the regex will fail in the case of all spaces.  Basically, the idiomatic perl way to strip leading and trailing spaces is for(@array) { s/^\s+//, s/\s+$// }



P.S.  It's hard to make comments legible without 'br' and 'p' tags, at least.</comment>

        <comment>And yes, I hear the pleas for comment sanity.

Due to how this site is built (AxKit/XML/XSLT) I can't just turn on HTML in comments without some major breakage.



As soon as I get a handle on DocBook, I'm going to start converting the site to it, widen the page widths and allow xhtml in comments to better deal with the display of code and such.



Considering the house purchase, I don't see it happening soon.</comment>

        <comment>Larry of Roanoke VA (12/15/03): 

Lowe's, through their credit card, offers no-interest promotional purchases from time to time. The problem is, Monogram Bank makes it very difficult to pay these off. When they receive your payment, they apportion it to the regular balance as well as any promotional purchases. It took us months to get them to properly apply our payments to promotional purchases so we could avoid the interest. Additionally, the monthly statement is very difficult to decipher. We will never use this credit card again!



Darlene of Leesburg VA writes (6/4/02): 

In October 2001, my fiance and I bought a new home. We decided to open separate Lowe's accounts (his limit was $250, mine was $300) to buy a washer and dryer. We purchased these and were given 6 months of "no payments". My first payment of $15 is due on June 19, 2002. 



On June 3, 2002, I received a letter from the Monogram Bank of Georgia stating that my account had been closed due to my credit score changing. I called and asked how they could cancel my account when I had done nothing wrong and my first payment wasn't even due yet. They stated that because I bought a home, my credit score dropped so after a review of my credit they decided to close my account. I argued that nothing had changed since I was approved by Lowe's. I was approved AFTER I had bought the home so they knew of this purchase BEFORE they approved me.



Now my credit will be adversely affected because they closed my account. How is it possible that they can close my account when I don't have bad credit with them? I am in perfect standing with them. Based on a "credit review", they are making a judgement about me that has nothing to do with my account with them. They also closed my fiance's account 2 months after he opened it for the same reason.



Ed of Lenoir City, TN (4/17/02): 

Lowes Credit Card issued 4/25/01 (later I found out it was issued by Monogram Bank Of Georgia) with a creit limit of $1500. Purchased refrigerator for about $1300 on a no-payments, no-interest basis until Jan 2002. Fine print says 6 months but promo was Jan 2002. In Nov 2001 I refinanced and paid off Sears, Pennys, Home Depot, and 3 credit cards totalling about $5000-$6000. Obviously, my credit score should have improved (had no delinquencies on any accounts and making monthly payments to Lowes).



In December I get a letter from Monogram Bank stating after reviewing my account they were lowering my credit limit to $500. My balance at the time was about $1250 because I had made some small purchases and I was making $20 monthly payments at the time. Now I find out that the credit bureaus show my Lowe's account as over the limit when I did nothing to cause this. Main office customer service denied this until I faxed a copy of my Eqifax credit report and then the response was there was nothing they could do that the decision was based on my credit file which, as I stated earlier, should have been better at this time than when the account was first opened.</comment>

        <comment>Lowes only rules if you can drive out of the store with the item.



I tried to order it on line.  Than I found out that on-line orders mean they send a little post-it note to the stores where it promptly gets lost.  And the order number their confirming email sent me means absolutely nothing to the Lowes store clerk.



And when they finally say they'll deliver sometime between 12 and 4, it means they still haven't found the order yet, but wait at home all day for nothing please.  And oh yeah, good luck getting your money back or a delivery.</comment>

        <comment>Another reason not to get MN-700 is the fact that you can't do bridging with it. In theory it should work but the two units I have tried caused severe network problems. I spent maybe 3 hours debugging the network only to find that the routers were to blame.</comment>

        <comment>True. For me at least, the MN-730 PCI cards have been way more consistant than the Linksys crap. And the MN-700's signal is just as good as my Linksys WAP11 WITH a signal booster on it.



Personally, I'm starting to think that on a whole, 99% of all wireless right now is complete junk unless you're buying high end (aka, non-best-buy-compusa-circuit-city models).</comment>

I have been trying to set one of my mn700's to access point mode to hook up to my xbox's in the living room.  The ap never gets the ip from the wireless dhcp router.  I read the usenet and saw a few times that this could not be done.  Do you have any pointers for me?  Both have the latest firmware according to the software microshaft made me install to get the updates.</comment>

        <comment>My objective was to move my desktop to another room without having to run ethernet cable.

Installed MS MN-730 with a DLink 731P router following package instructions - no problem.  MN-730 couldn't router.  Rebooted cable modem - problem solved.  Now, however, internet response time is horrible, only a fraction of the response time I was getting from my straight Ethernet connection, and thus unacceptable (even though the system says the MN-730 is running at 11mps to my router).

Anybody know why this happened, or how to fix it?



By the way, my Netgear and Linksys cards in my laptops work great using the same router.</comment>

        <comment>Thanks for sharing, Chris.  I also do the computer thing for a living.  In anticipation of getting cable Internet at home later this year (thanks for nothing, Verizon!), I picked up an MN-700 (for $60, yet!) at my nearby Target store.  When I revealed this event to my boss, he threw a possibly flaky Netgear WAB501 my way so that I can test it.  I've been itching to get home early enough to find out how nice it is to sync offline files from halfway across the house.  "Watching" your "movie" here has opened my eyes; if I have to troubleshoot, I'll do it swiftly and without mercy in order to save myself the grief.</comment>

I got it home, set it up as a base station and it Just Worked™.  Curious to see if there was a firmware update (I am anal about BIOS, firmware and driver updates!), I found one.  I downloaded the updater, updated the unit, and then rebooted it.  When I logged back in, it had retained all of my settings (as it should have) and had indeed updated the firmware.



I have yet to experience any problems with the router -- the wired and wireless portions work flawlessly.

        <comment>I used to work for Microsoft and have actually worked in the hardware group. The General Manager wanders around looking lost most of the time and organizes fantasy football pools. Quite a few of the program managers have an IQ slightly above a rock and lesser than an earth worm. The place is a sorry excuse for a loser lifestyle.



Now that having been said - The MN700 impressed me with its ability. The honeymoon vanished when 10 minutes later after ascertaining the router abilities of the dang thingy I switched it to AP mode. It cannot acquire an IP from the router, if I present it a friggin' ip from a locked "pool" give it the subnet and point it to the router it still does not work. Tell me - if this sad arse group did not have the shielding of Microsoft would they have survived a minute in the marketplace ?</comment>

        <comment>I have a WMP11 card in one of my PCs, and I too get the random disconnects, but I've come to notice it's not so random after all - it seems to disconnect after a certain amount of data has passed through it - I can reliably and consistently kill it by trying to copy a CD image across it. I haven't figured out exactly what byte count kill it yet, but it seems to be somewhere around 400-500 megs. Regular usage will kill it after a couple of days. Heavy network file ops will do it in a matter of hours. 



At least with SP2, it's a simple matter of "repairing" the connection, which disconnects, reconnects, reassociates, and then renews the IP address. Kills your file transfer, though.</comment>

        <comment>Hello I have recently upgraded my WRT54G to the latest firmware 2.02.2 and I am starting to get the "The semaphore timeout period has expired. . Your computer will continue to try and obtain an address on its own from the network address (DHCP) server" error's on my laptop.  I have WAP-PSK (TKIP) enabled.  I have used this router for about 20 days on the orginal firmware; 2.00.8



I am going to reflash the unit with the previous firmware and if that cures the problem I will just be left out until a firmware is issued to correct this issue.

        <comment>I've just resorted to switching back to WEP 128 bit from WPA-PSK.  I've narrowed it down to the fact that the 801.2xx authentication option is automatically ticked (checked) with WPA and is also disabled, so that the user is unable to amend it.



Since the authentication is only ever of use if you have a RADIUS server or some other certification server sitting out there, it times out attempting to authenticate and therefore will not obtain a DHCP lease.  



My original solution was to manually kick it into action by forcing it to look for the router or restarting the router.



The question is whether the fault lies with Windows and it's setup for wireless authentication or Linksys drivers?</comment>

We have differing definitions of "works really well," possibly.  



If you post your regex, I'll be more than happy to post HTML that is &lt;a href="http://validator.w3.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;valid&lt;/a&gt; and will break your regex.  Parsing HTML is harder than people realize...



Shameless plus to &lt;a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl" rel="nofollow"&gt;PerlMonks &lt;/a&gt; for all your regex (and non-regex issues like parsing) needs.</comment>

        <comment>Hi there,



I searched a long time how to get my RDF-/RSS-Files correctly styled in IE.



They are correctly displayed in Opera and Mozilla, but IE just doesn't accept

any rules for tags that have an "rdf:" or "dc:" or any other namespace before them.



If you write:

RDF

{

  /* ... */

}

the &amp;lt;rdf:RDF&amp;gt;-Element is correctly styled in Mozilla and Opera but not in IE.



But if you write:

rdf\:RDF

{

  /* ... */

}

the &amp;lt;rdf:RDF&amp;gt;-Element is correctly styled in IE! Opera also understands that

workaround, but Mozilla doesn't. So you just write:

rdf\:RDF, RDF

{

  /* ... */

}

and everybody is happy. :-)



There should be no need for any "|"-Selector or any @namespace.



Hope that helps,

Alexander Koch

        <comment>&gt; what about RSS/RDF?



I ran into this same issue.  In the &lt;a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss" rel="nofollow"&gt;RSS 2.0 Specification&lt;/a&gt;, it does not indicate one way or another.  I got around it by wrapping it in CDATA.  That's what seems to work in most clients.



I would assume a similar trick is necessary for the other versions of RSS.</comment>

I think your common sense parser is set to strict and the rest of the world is parsing rather more liberally. Don't be so Safari baby, be more IE...

        <comment>I've been trying to get it working over the last month. It's been quite the adventure! Once you figure it out, it's a very nice tool for testing web applications.



There was a recent discussion on the mailing list regarding working directories. I believe the outcome of the discussion was that cwd would no longer be performed. I also think this change is in CVS now. It sounded like it would take awhile to get the all of tests working with this modification.



My workaround is to check the working dir and append t/ if not already present. Fortunately, I have only 1 test which needs this hack.



As for the quoting issue, you ought to mention it on the mailing list or, better yet, provide a patch.</comment>

        <comment>Yeah, I'm actually a lurker on the test-dev@ mailing list and noticed the CVS fix.



Now the real question is: will my hackaround still work after the fix makes it into a release?</comment>

        <comment>Hmmm... that's a tricky one.  "use" is done at compile time (and is the equivilent of a "require" and "import" done in sequence) while the other two (aforementioned "require" and "import") are done during run time.



I am assuming that has something to do with it, but you would need someone with a deeper understanding to explain further.

ANd therein lies the problem. If I'm working with 2-5 other developers, I can't possibly expect the Design View tab to never get clicked. Accidents happen. I click renders the source useless.  That's not acceptable.</comment>

        <comment>The fundamentals of VS seem to support xhtml, but layers of stuff over the basics are ill behaved.  Some ways to get what you want:

1)  Start in source mode.  If you can, never touch that horrible design mode.

2)  If you use design mode (like placing controls) do it at the start of building an aspx.  After using it fix the information that has been messed up.  Then never go in again.

3)  If you touch an aspx with design mode put the header into the clipboard first!

4)  After the development is done load it into a staging web server.  Go in there with some decent tools (Homesite still has a place...) and fix the formatting.  Publish to live site from there.



If you're using the xhtml (produced by your ASPX) from code this is NOT optional.



I'd love to see an alternative to the "design surface".  The UI in Homesite based on WYSIWYN (What you see is what you need) is so superior it takes you breath away.</comment>

        <comment>Here here!



I totally agree more. I've just spent an hour wasting my time trying to figure out why ReceiveTimeout didn't affect the timeout for connecting. 



Do you know if there are there any plans in the pipeline to implement a ConnectTimeout or equivalent?</comment>

        <comment>I don't see any way in the documentation to do this with a TcpClient, but if you had a System.Net.Sockets.Socket instead, you could use BeginConnect/EndConnect to do a connection timeout.



I had to do something similar a while back.  I ended up creating a private wrapper class holding a reference to the Socket, plus a reference to a ManualResetEvent.  When I need to do the connect, I set up a new wrapper, then called the Socket's BeginConnect method (the state object is the wrapper class).  In the AsyncCallback delegate's target method, I Set() the event, then call EndConnect() on the socket.



Back in the main function, I do a WaitOne on the ManualResetEvent (the overload that has a timeout).  If the timeout elapses, then I close the socket (which invokes the AsyncCallback, which when I call EndConnect(), throws either a SocketException with ErrorCode 10061, or an ObjectDisposedException, which I ignore).  Otherwise, I continue, and close the socket later.



It's only about 15-25 lines of code in all.  Of course, that's still a heck of a lot more than a Connect overload that takes a timeout, but it is at least possible.



If you could get at the Socket reference of the TcpClient, you could do something similar.  But I don't think you can (I don't believe the Socket is even created until you try to connect the TcpClient, though I could be wrong on that).</comment>

        <comment>How do you like the MTD PRO.  Does it handle rounded grass areas better than a standard mower?  I heard with the solid 6 speed drive (chain) it is difficult to back up.  Comments Please as I am about to order from SamsClub but would like some user experience feedback first.</comment>

        <comment>I like it just fine. It was hard to get used to the first day, but

after that it's fine.

If you're going to mow at an angle, like next to the road/ditch,

you'll befinately want to lock the front wheels.



It's not hard to pull in reverse at all.



Also, it would be eaiser toreply if you're email wasn't undeliverable. :-)

        <comment>Hey, I am going to have a lawn to mow for the 1st time and I am shopping for a mower .. lawn is around 1/4 acre or more..I was looking at this mower at Sam's also and saw it in store for around 299 now. I was trying to figure out if it was better to go with this than a Craftsman Mower in same price range? any suggesitons? Also is this a self propelled or push mower and would you recommend it for a beginner? Thanks!</comment>

        <comment>Bugger! Seems to me, that's why the people sold that house. Unfortunately it's been you, buying it. What was the reason again for leaving the old house? Anyway, I am sure you will take this challenge successfully, too.

Good luck,

        <comment>Maybe, but it's a six year old house. The lady who we bought it from didn't even live there for that last two years. She got married and moved to Maine. It's not like it's a 50k house, it's a big phat colonial.



Oh well. Find me a house without any problems and I have some swampland in Florida to sell you. :-)</comment>

Next, please explain to my simple self, how do you manage php in xhtml 1.1 being served application/xhtml+xml ?



Or can it only be managed by the using php to send the headers ?</comment>

        <comment>As a former reservist, I can sympathize with Mr. Parish - up to a point.  I can't speak as to the particulars of his enlistment contract.  However, in my experience, I was informed and aware of, up front, that after my 8 years of reserve duty were completed, that I would be then transferred to the IRR (Individual Ready Reserve), from which, in time of national need, I could be reactivated, until age 51.  The language in the enlistment contracts that I've seen from the different brances of service is very consistent about this.  I will be following Mr. Parish's case with interest.</comment>

        <comment>I have to agree on that point. If he was informed verbally or contractually that he would be put in IRR and it's obligations, then I think he's just plain stuck.



Now, on that note, I think the manditory placement of people into the IRR is slightly questionable.</comment>

        <comment>I agree with you on mandatory placement in the IRR, but my (former) father-in-law, who was an officer in the Army Signal Corps put it this way:   'After you sign on the dotted line, you're theirs.  Especially if your rate/MOS is considered critical.'  He finished his active duty with NASA doing satellite communications networks, then retired a few years ago, still consulting for NASA and the odd government agency.

        <comment>I can highly recommend KAV (Kaspersky Antivirus, from www.kasperskylabs.com) as a lean, mean, virus killing machine!



However, it's best to go on something a little more objective than personal preference, so see here:

        <comment>Our tests of firefox pr 1 for OS X were similarly disappointing. We were able to auto detect some feeds but subscribed feeds did not stick after restarting the app. Once feeds were subscribed, attempting to open the bookmarks menu would cause the app to crash. This was repeated many times successively.



Was also slow as a dog and we could hear the processor and drives grinding away as soon as we launched the app. We’re assuming (hoping) the performance and bugginess will be taken care of by the time 1.0 is finalized.



That said, 0.9.3 is an amazing browser and PR 1 looks to be even better if they can address these problems. IE/Safari/Opera look out!

        <comment>No problems with my bookmarks here.  I would have to 2nd the complaint of Firefox 1.0PR being dog slow.  There is a noticable performance hit compared to 0.9.3  However, I do like the live bookmark implementation of RSS.  I like not having to fire up yet another app to read feeds.  It seems Firefox 1.0PR wants to see a content-type tag set to the feed type (rss, xml, atom).  Not all sites that have feeds have this.  Hopefully they'll fix the performance issues fairly soon. In the meantime I just may go back to 0.9.3</comment>

        <comment>I had a bookmarks disappear problem as well.  What happened was that I had the Sage extension installed and everything worked fine.  I decided to remove Sage and after I restarted the browser, my bookmarks were gone as well as the bookmark toolbar.  I then went to the Bookmarks-&gt;Manage Bookmarks and saw all my bookmarks were still there.  I then exited and my bookmarks showed up from the Bookmarks dropdown list but toolbar was still missing.  I then re-installed Sage and now I have my bookmarks back.</comment>

        <comment>Hi there, I had thought Firefox 1.0PR had broken the BugMeNot extension also but then I saw that the extension (in version 0.6) made a UI change around the same time as the 1.0PR release.



Now BugMeNot only shows up in the Firefox Right Click Context Menu if you put your mouse pointer over a username/password field.



So it was there and working fine but I took some time to notice it.

        <comment>As a techno-shmuck wage slave competing with outsourced Indian technicians for $12/hr with no benefits, I'm with Chris on this.  Under Bush's healthcare plan I get squat!  Bush's plan 'allows small businesses to band together to lower healthcare costs'....sheeeeit!  In Ohio we've been ahead of the prez for years...it's called COSE, and if it was so great, my employer would've joined.  Kerry's got the right idea on this one.  Also, Kerry is just a tad more concerned about civil liberties than the president.  Kerry acknowledged along with the Congressional Republican leadership that the Patriot Act need to be fixed with regards to civil liberties.  Bush, as is characteristic, refused to even acknowledge that there is a problem...'I hope you don't think that the Patriot Act and Patriot Act II weakens civil liberties - they don't'...give me a break!  Kerry's got my vote.</comment>

        <comment>It seems to be indexing for me okay so far. I don't think it is indexing Firefox either. I don't have Thunderbird on this computer, so I can't test that. We do have to remember it is beta, and they may add those in later. We should all put in a request so it gets done.</comment>

        <comment>I couldn't agree more. I still have not been able to get this @#$%^&amp;* game to work and I've spent consideraly more time than an hour looking at firewall and steam logs. It appears to connect to multiple servers and get closed out. 



I about ready to do to the AG and file suit to get my money back. This is totally rediculous.</comment>

        <comment>&lt;p&gt;Where you able to generate dynamic buttons in ASP.NET or just in ASP/vbScript? I am about to hang myself after tinkering with it for a week and I have yet to successfully submit a dynamically encrypted button. All I ever get from the PayPal sandbox is&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are sorry that we are experiencing temporary difficulties. Please try again later.&lt;/p&gt;

        <comment>I really enjoyed JK2 and KOTOR and would have LOVED to see some other "quality games" come out of LA but unfortunately, George doesn't give a crap about the PC gamers. For him, the money is in Consoles ESPECIALLY, with all of the latest stuff coming out, he can easily "pick and choose" which platform he wants to develop for. He is a powerful guy that has a lot of leverage within the community as a whole.

        <comment>There were extremely excellent and the best scenes in the movie "Revenge of the Sith".

Good originality and great imagination, great story in this movie!

Here's Photo gallery for Hayden Christensen(Anakin) of this movie. &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0159789/photogallery-ss-0" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0159789/photogallery-ss-0&lt;/a&gt;

        <comment>What's even more amusing is that implantation results in about a 65% chance of failure.  So by insisting that we do not use the embroys for stem cell research because it's not natural to kill them, he insinuates that the moral thing to do would be to implant them.  In other words, immediately kill 65% of them that could've been used for research.  He's retarded.</comment>

I'm just curious how/where I might know you from?  I honestly don't remember commenting that post before.  You seem like an interesting guy, I just can't place you...</comment>

        <comment>If you can keep all the variations of dialect straight enough to properly compare my hats off to you. Why not build the application once and complete in one framework, then pit that against another in the second round, winner progresses, etc etc.



For Rails I suggest that before you tackle a section, review the relevant RailsCasts.com (Ryan Bates) on that section. Also grab the WhatsNew in Rails 2.1 pdf (2nd Edition).



Good luck!</comment>

        <comment>I chose to complete each step in all frameworks together is that I should be able to better compare each step across all frameworks. My fear with completing the project on one framework before moving to another was that I would forget my thoughts and grievances byt the time I moved on to a new framework.

        <comment>I'll have to think about that. I am using the RC2 of CakePHP. My fear with trunk Django is that if I run into problrms, I might be in new territory. Whereas if I stick with .96, plenty of people have made it through that already.



Plus, I installed using fink on my MBP as I didn't want to fight any install issues...just get it all up an running asap.</comment>

        <comment>I think you should more fear the fact that 0.96 is one year old and that plenty of enhancements have been made since. :-)



I guess most of the people currently working with django use trunk, and a lot of useful applications are based on django-trunk (e.g django-registration, django-evolution, etc...)



Anyway, good luck ;)</comment>

Because that's what fink curreny has and I didn't want to spend any more time than necessary installing and upgrading to non-release versions.



The only reason I'm using CakePHP 1.2 non-release that it's 0-install.</comment>

        <comment>Hi, nice series! Looking forward to the other parts. Note that Rails adds the created_at and updated_at columns because of the "t.timestamps" line in your migration file. Remove that and they won't get created. It is there by default, but it is easily removed.</comment>
