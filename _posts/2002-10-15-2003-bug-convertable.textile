I stumbled across <a href="http://www.vwvortex.com/news/09_02/09_12/index.shtml" title="VW Audi Convertable defailt page">this link</a> to the 2003 Volkswagen New Beetle convertible over at <a href="http://www.escobosa.com/" title="Visit escobosa.com"><cite>Marc Escobosa's site</cite></a>.

Well, it looks nice. Let's hope it runs better. Everyone I know with some sort of VW has had nothing but problems. Maybe it's in the water here.
