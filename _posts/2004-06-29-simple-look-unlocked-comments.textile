I think I like the new simple style on this site right now. No loads of sidebar links and unneed information overload. Since most people seem to be comsuming my rantage via RSS, I guess it really matters not one bit.

On that note, I've re-enabled comments for regular old non-TypeKey users. I'm sure this means I'll have to spend time every other day deleting 100+ unapproved spam robot comments. How fun.
