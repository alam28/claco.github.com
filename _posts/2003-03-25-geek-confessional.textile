Forgive me Father for I have sinned. I have taken up gaming with another who is not my own video card. I know I shouldn't, but I've had impure thoughts and just don't feel happy with my old GeForce Ti4400. I have also purchased from the forsaken garden of Best Buy after vowing I would not do so. The temptation of higher frame rates was just to great in this time of need. I was weak and vulnerable while my Ti4400 makes the pilgrimage back to it's creator for replacement under the great and holy warranty.</cite>
