It annoys the hell out of me when I lose or misplace things. I could loose my ass if it wasn't attached. The office is a wreck, especially after building my new computer and also have the old computer parts lying around waiting to be assembled.

So, I felt like installing Enter The Matrix this evening, and I can't find Disc 1. <strong>#$%$#!</strong> Moral of the story: <em>put shit away when you're done with it</em>. Lesson #2: <em>always make backups of your CD's before you do anything else</em>. Assuming of course that these assholes haven't implimented some copy protection (aka, fuck over the honest customers) scheme so I can't even make backups of my own damn software.

But I digress.<br />
Good Fight. Good Night.
