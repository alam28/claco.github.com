Once I finished building my new PC, I had the task of reassembling my old HP Pavilion 771n. They're not the greatest machines on Earth, but I've been pretty lucky with them <em>before they and Cpmpaq merged</em>.
</p>
<p>
So like the retard I am, in a frenzy of taking my new rig to a LAN party I pulled the wrong cable and the 771n went crashing to the floor from about 4 feet up on a desk.
Parts went flying everywhere.  The case bezel. The bezel inserts. The top. The top CD lid. The top insert.  <strong>@#$%^!</strong>
</p>
<p>
Much to my surprise, <strong>nothing</strong> was broke. It all snapped back together without any problems, and the hard drive survived.  Kinda cool actually, not that I want to try it again anytime soon.
