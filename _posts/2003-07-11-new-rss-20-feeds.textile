Well, I had a few minutes to tinker, and tinker I did. I've added two new RSS 2.0 feeds.
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/blog/rss2.xml">RSS 2.0 Feed</a> - This contains excerpts of the last 25 posts just like the RSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0 feeds.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/rss2full.xml">RSS 2.0 Full Post Feed</a> - This contains the full version of the last <strong>15</strong> posts.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I haven't made my mind up about inline images in the posts yet. On the one hand, I don't want to hard code them with my domain name. Hardcoding Bad.
Yet, it sure would be nice if they worked properly in RSS readers. Wonder if there is a &lt;base&gt; tag in the RSS spec somwhere?
