I've <em>finally</em> "finshed" a project. By finished I mean the NUnit tests were written, the C# code completed, and the compiled HTML help documentation is done.

I haven't been able to do that in...yeah: <strong>NEVER</strong>, at least not at work. That's why I turned it into a skunkworks project at home so I could complete software to the level I wanted it to be at.

Go figure.

No, let's see if I can do the same with that website -&gt; mod_perl conversion project I've been sitting on forever.
