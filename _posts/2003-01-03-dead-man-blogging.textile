<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/" title="Visit pepysdiary.com">This</a> is the most creative blogging idea I've seen in a while; It is the <cite>The Diary of Samuel Pepys (1633-1703)</cite> blogged daily, entry by entry as if Mr. Pepys himself was blogging. I think this would be a facinating way to study history. Have a hard time learning the sequence of events leading up to say WWII or The Battle of *, blog it chronologically. I bet it would work.

Now all of the great writers of the past can get in there long overdue "First Post Bitches!".
