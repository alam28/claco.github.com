IMHO, if we want to save face with the world about these abuse photos, we need to let these abusers be tried for war crimes under the Geneva Convention by a country not involved in the war. Nothing less will do. Anything less is a joke related to 'fair' justice.

On that note, while I don't condone the abuse, I understand it. Some of these soldiers are "National Guard". They aren't suppoed to be overseas in a war. Period. They're supposed to be here to protect us in the time of need. Probably not trained for an overseas war. They're already stressing. So I can see how these things happen.
