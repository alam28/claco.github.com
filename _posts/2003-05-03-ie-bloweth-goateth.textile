Once again, showing how much ass IE really does suck. Now you can <a href="http://www.secunia.com/advisories/8642/">DDoS IE with a single line of code</a> (The link is safe. It goes to a security notice).
</p>
<p>
And the magic line is (drumroll please....) :
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>
&lt;input type&gt;
</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
