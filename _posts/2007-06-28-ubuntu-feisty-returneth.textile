After a drive crash torched my XP/Ubuntu install about 5 months ago, I haven't spent much time looking at Ubuntu Feisty. I just finished installing Feisty back on the laptop. I must say, it's much better than Badger.

The fonts render better. The wireless card worked out of the gate, which is a first. The network and other admin panels are much better. What an improvement. Way to go Ubuntu.
