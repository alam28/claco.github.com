OK, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Test::Pod&amp;mode=module">this Test module</a> is really really sick in a cool sort of way. For those who hate writing documentation even more than writing unit tests, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Test::Pod&amp;mode=module">Test::Pod</a> is for you. And for the really sick at heart, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Test::Pod::Coverage&amp;mode=module">Test::Pod::Coverage</a> can compare your Pod to your module and make sure you're documentating those new subs you've just added.
