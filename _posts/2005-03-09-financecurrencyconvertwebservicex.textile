Scratching another itch while adding currency conversion to AxKit::XSP::Currency and Handel.

This is a lightweight module to do currency conversion using the Curency Convertor web service at http://www.webservicex.net/.

The motivation for this module was many fold. First, Finance::Currency::Convert with Finance::Quote was a little too bulky for my needs, esp the need to download or maintain conversion tables. Finance::Currency::Convert::Yahoo seemed to be based on screen scraping. Way to fragile for my taste. Finance::Currency::Convert::XE has usage restrictions from XE.com.
