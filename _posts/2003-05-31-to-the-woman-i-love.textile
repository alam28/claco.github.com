<blockquote>
<p>

It goes without saying, yet is never said enough.<br />
You have changed my life in ways I can't even describe.<br />
To wake up next to you every day makes me feel safe and complete.<br />
You are so smart, loving, understanding and compationate.<br />
You spend your days helping children in need of care.<br />
You spend your days going to school to better yourself.<br />
Yet you still come home to me;<br />
Make dinner. Pamper me. Cuddle me. Love Me.<br />
Loving. Understanding. Patient.<br />
Tolerant of me being lazy when you're tired.<br />
I should be doing more to help you.<br />
You are a better person than I in many ways.<br />
You spoil and love without asking in return.<br />
I am truly lucky to have you in my life.<br />
To help me learn. To help me grow. To help me love.<br /><br />

May there be many more slow weekends full of snuggles, shopping, movies, cooking, baths, travel and any other activity where we can be together. :-)
