<p>
So I finally got a little time to start working on writing (reinventing the wheel) a quick and dirty ecommerce package based on AxKit so I can convert my one remaining IIS4/ASP site.

As with all things new, I'm sticking to the plan and writing my tests as I go. So far, it's not been that bad. Since it's mostly SQL work via Class::DBI, I'm spending more time really testing Class::DBI instead of my own code. Thanks to a little DBD::SQLite, I think that's ok. It means the Class::DBI is doing it's job and I'm  barely writing any code of my own.
