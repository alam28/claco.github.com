I called PNY this morning to fetch my lost RMA# to return my supposedly flakey Ti4400 GeForce4 card. (I have since purchased an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro)
Just for giggles, I reinstalled it. While I did get some junk lines during BIOS POST, the card worked. I installed updated drivers and it is now functioning fully. Same mobo. Same computer. Same everything.</p>

Isn't technology grand? Fuck you St. Murphy. :-)
