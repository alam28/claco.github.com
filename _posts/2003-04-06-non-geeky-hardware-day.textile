Just another day looking at or buying new hardware. This time they're non-computer related. First I had to stop by the local Home Despot for a new toilet seat and to take a look at backup sump pumps for the basement.
Then it was on to Advanced Auto parts for an inline fuse wire and a new battery for the truck. What fun.
