To those who know me, it's no secret that I'm not a skinny guy. I'm 6'4" tall and am big boned. Not huge, but not skinny by any means.
With that said, I am addicted to food, or rather the consumption of said item. Some people do drugs, some people steal, some people become nymphos. I like eating. It's a simple pleasure in life that I'm more than willing to take advantage of.

In an effort to stop snacking on junk food, cola, chips, candy, etc. I decided that I really really like beef jerky. Peppered. Sweet. Hot. Regular. 
Since it's not bread or chips or candy then it can't be to bad for me right? Wrong. I'd forgotten the one drawback to spicy jerky: The Exit Process. :-)
