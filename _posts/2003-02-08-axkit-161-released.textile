<p>
I've been waiting for this bug fix release so I could finally get pipe characters to show up properly. Congrats and thanks to everyone who made this release happen.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The AxKit development team are proud to announce the release of AxKit 
1.6.1.
</p>

<p>
   http://axkit.org/download/AxKit-1.6.1.tar.gz
   or your local CPAN mirror (may take 24 hours to propogate)
</p>

<p>
This is a bug fix and minor feature release. Highlights of this release 
are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A new AxExternalEncoding option which allows you to have filesystems and other external resources that aren't stored as UTF-8.</li>
<li>A finalized AxHandleDirs option that allows Apache's directory handlers to return XML representing the directory to AxKit for further processing.</li>
 <li>A re-architecture of the internals of AxKit's XSP engine, including:
     <ul>
         <li>All node building is done in separate functions rather than direct DOM calls to reduce the size of XSP code</li>
         <li>Major memory and reduction of XSP generated perl code</li>
         <li>XSP pages can inherit from a different base class and implement wrapper code easily</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Major fixes to "axkit:" URIs (i.e. they actually work now for most cases)</li>
  <li>Fixed caching when AxGzipOutput is off</li>
  <li>Slightly improved demo site code</li>
   <li>Added AxDebugTidy option to use Perl::Tidy on XSP debug dumps</li>
   <li>Many bug fixes, debug log improvements, and code cleanups</li>
   <li>An updated axkit.org web site - http://axkit.org/</li>
</ul>
<p>
We hope you enjoy this release, and do keep the bug reports flowing.
</p>
<p>
Matt.
