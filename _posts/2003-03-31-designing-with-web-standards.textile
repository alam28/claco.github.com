I can't wait to get my paws on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018/ref%3Dnosim/jeffreyzeldmanprA/102-3740158-6344938">Designing With Web Standards</a> by Jeffrey Zeldman. I'm alreay pre-ordered and ready to read. While I was ther, I snagged <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1886411743/102-3740158-6344938">Absolute BSD: The Ultimate Guide to FreeBSD</a> by Michael Lucas and Jordan Hubbard.  All the reviews are 5 starts, and every seems to rave about the book. Number 5 needs more input.
