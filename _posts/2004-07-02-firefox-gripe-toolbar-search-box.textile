This is about my only realy gripe with Firefox. I always wish I could change the size and/or position of the toolbar search box.

My laptop runs at 1600x1200, and my desktops run at 1280x1024. With those kinds of sizes, the search box is always waaaaaay over on the right when I need it. That's a pain in the ass in a reading left-to-right environment.

<ins><em>Yes, I just realized I can customize a toolbar and drag the search box to the left. That's on half of the problem solved.</em></ins>

I also wish I could click-drag the left side of the searchbox and make it larger. As a programmer, I'm usuall searching for much longer strings, especially when I'm searching MSDN for .NET namespaces.

I'm sure there is some XUL/CSS magic I could conjure up. I just shouldn't even have to.

<ins><em>Two for two. Apparently I'm <a href="http://www.digitalmediaminute.com/article/672">not the only one</a> who hates the size. Thanks for the CSS example.</em></ins>
