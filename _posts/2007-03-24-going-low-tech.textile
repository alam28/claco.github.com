I'm a programmer. I'm not a designer. I've never seen a site design I like that I also like on my content. Since I need to post more, and worry about design less, I'm going low tech. The new layout is pure minimal content with a little of style from the MT Style Contest, modified to style the Google Search AJAX API. Ugly, but functional.
