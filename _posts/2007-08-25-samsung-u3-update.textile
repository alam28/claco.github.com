Once I decided on a bitrate vs. size that I could tolerate on this player, I've started ripping CDs and filling this little monster. Once of the cool features this player has is that I can alter the play speed, so I can play drums along with songs at half speed if I have to. Kinda cool. I've got about 10 CDs or so @ 96kbps, which works out to about 35MB per CD.

That bit rate sounds low compared to the VBR/320/nothing less than 128 mantra, but honestly, for most types of music, you just don't hear the difference on this kind of player. With a 2GB limit, it's all about how many songs I can cram on it before I regret not getting the 4GB version. :-)
