Well, mostly. I've always wanted a MacBook Pro, but the price is a serious guilt trip and my 5 year old lappy was still going string...until tonight. When I went to open the lid, the hinges basicly exploded along with the case plastics around them. It literally won't survive another lid close/open.

It's a sign a tell ya. Without too much guilt, I ordered a reburbished 17" 1920x1200 7200rmp MBP from the Apple Store. It was $450 cheaper than a new one and has the same warranty. That price difference is just enough to pay for AppleCare, save $100 and feel just a little bit less guilty about the whole ordeal. :-)
