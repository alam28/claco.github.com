Now, if you're running XP as a user without administrator (and probably power user) privs, <strong>make sure you format the removable stick/usb drive using NTFS</strong>. I failed to do so the first time, and firefox complained about the drive being read only, even thought it wasn't. Rumor this is an XP/FAT32 issue.
