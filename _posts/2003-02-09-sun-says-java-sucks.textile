<p>
I've seen this posted a couple days ago, and now it's on this <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/03/02/09/1347215.shtml?tid=108">Slashdot post</a>, and on this <a href="http://www.internalmemos.com/memos/memodetails.php?memo_id=1321">Internal Memos entry</a>. Apparently, Sun developers don't really like Java and find it unusable for internal development. Definately another fine example of not eating your own dog food.
