Well, after 3 days, I finished Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy on the first difficulty level.
I think the end boss was a little easier than in JK2: Jedi Outcast, but it was fun none the less. JA is going to be more fun to play again because I can choose levels in different orders, switch to duel sabers, and use a different character. 
I really like the fact that you play 5 missions, any order, then have to complete one big mission. Then another 5 missions and another big one.

Let the games [re]begin.
