I'm always late to the party...really late sometimes. I never got into Counter Strike or the original Half-Life. Last night I decided to fire up Counter Strike CS since it came with Half-Life<sup>2</sup>. Now I understand the addiction. I'll never got those 3 hours back.

Of course, I still haven't installed STALKER yet, and I still have programming to do before I start playing it.
