<p>
After only two months I've managed to acquire a fix list for the new [to me, built in 1997] house. At least it's all relatively cheap things.
</p>
<ul>
<li><del>Scrape/paint all exterior door jams. Especially the ones facing West.</del></li>
<li><del>Install storm doors on West facing doors to prevent the above from happening again. :-)</del></li>
<li>Recaulk window exteriors and doorways to help stave off lady bug invasion.</li>
<li>Install new bottom seal on garage door.</li>
<li>Caulk around porch and step.</li>
<li>Paint/seal interior garage block and caulk around corners.</li>
<li>Paint/seal exterior block.</li>
<li><del>Renail railing on deck.</del></li>
<li>New deck boards on deck.</li>
<li>Remove two trees next to driveway.</li>
<li>Order more limestone to finish widening driveway.</li>
<li>Replace delapodated bird feeder</li>
<li>Patch hole in exterior block on garage.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Lots of stuff to do. But eat least it's nothing like the last house: waterproof basement, new roof, windows, etc.
