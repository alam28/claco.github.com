I forgot to mention it before, and I was gone all day yesterday with Margeaux and my parents. I'm 31. [And there was much rejoicing....yeeeaaahhh].

We picked my parents up for breakfast in the morning, then we drove out to Amish country and hit some antique malls in the area. We didn't pick up a lot of stuff. Just some Siamese cat salt/pepper shakers, some other Siamese figurines. We also snagged this really tall hand driven water pump for the front yard.

I'd post a pick of it but I don't have a digital camera. Well, we had one, but it's life was ended prematurely on the concrete garage floor. Maybe I should go fix that this evening. Any recommendations?  I want good picture quality, but I don't need to many bells and whistles.
