The new <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BUSH?SITE=OHCOD&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">Identity Theft Sentencing law</a> will have zero effect on Identity theft. We have the death penalty and life sentences and that hasn't stopped murder has it?

Sentencing is not the problem. If you really want to help people who suffer from identity fraud, give them better tools and laws to fix the situation once it happened rather than forcing them to wade through too much paperwork and 7 years of a bad credit while fighting crediters and credit agencies to get things corrected.
