<p>
I've been thinking about <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000208/">making that knowledge base blog</a> again, and it comes down to this. Do I create an entirely new blog, new config, new files, new templates, yada, yada, or do I just add new categories to this blog? Seperate and unteathered would be nice, but I'm not sure I want to deal with all the seperate files, mergin the searches, etc. What do you think?

While I'm at it, I've been thinking about adding another RSS feed with full posts. Partial post feeds are starting to annoy me.
