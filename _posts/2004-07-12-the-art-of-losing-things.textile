Margeaux and I have now officially mastered the art of losing things in the quickest time possible.

Yesterday we went to Home Despot and purchased a tube of white silicone sealer, among other items. Last night and this morning, it was sitting on the kitchen counter. It has now disappeared. We have scoured the house and it is nowhere to be found.

It is off somewhere having a grand old time with The One-armed Man, Elvis, the real Paul McCartney, Jimmy Hoffa, JonBenet Ramsey's killer, and every single missing sock. Salute.
