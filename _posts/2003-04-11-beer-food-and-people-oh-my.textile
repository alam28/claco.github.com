Finally, a relaxing Friday at home. The woman is home. Her friend from Europe is here. Good food. Beer in hand. I'll drink to that. :-)

Tomorrow our new furniture gets delivered. We snagged two tall bookshelves with a middle armour/entertainment center. Good stuff. We even went to Pier 1 to get some small fake plantage, lamps ans such for decoraiton.
That place is pure evil.

We also bought a Floor Mate and went on a cleaning spree. I still have to finish cleaning the office, and Sunday I have to build a new FreeBSD server for work. It's gonna be a long weekend me thinks.
