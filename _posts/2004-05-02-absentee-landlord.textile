I feel like and absentte landlord for this site right now. Work is burning me out with multiple "high priority" overdue projects at once, and things have been busy around here.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/blog/archives/entries/000467/">The truck</a> is is sold and the proceeds have paid off all the appliances for this house and my credit card, which is now closed. More on that later. 
</p>
<p>
Now it looks as if the old house may be close to selling as well, which means I can pay off my 2 month old car loan. That puts us down to a single mortgage and car loan which means we can finally get "settled" again.
</p>
<p>
Now back to the credit card. It was a CapitalOne card with a semi-crappy rate. Every damn month or so, those idiots would send me "Now, new low rates if you sign up now" snail mail spam, which was stupid considering I was <em>already</em> their customer. Everytime I would call to see if they would lower the rate, and they refused. Now, when I called to payoff the card and cancel my account, they wanted to know why. So I told them about the monthly offers and the refusals to lower my rate.
</p>
<p>
Of course, now that I'm closing my account they want to lower my rate. I told them to get bent. They had their chance. That was fun. :-)
