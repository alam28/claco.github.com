I've been pretty much appointed the technology dictator for a huge project at work. Holy stressful batman. I know I know things, maybe more than others, but I'm just never comfortable with the thought that I'm the guy to make the decisions.

Ask a group of people who knows what they're doing. The ones who do answer "I have no idea". The ones who don't answer "Absolutely".
