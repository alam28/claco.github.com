19 hours drive including all the potty breaks. Not bad. The hotel is the REnaissance Grand right downtown. This is the most awesome hotel I've ever stayed in. Time for a little surfing, booze, and tv. Tomorrow I'll be programming while the she does her nursing thing at the conference; or something like that.

OH yeah, my XM Radio lighter adapter died about 3 hours in: it blew it's fuse. Of course, not a single Truck Stops of America has the right size of fuse...even the ones that actually sell XM Radio units. Nice.
