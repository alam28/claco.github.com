<p>
Lord knows I must be stupid because this took way too long:
</p>
<pre><code>if (eval {require Apache::Test}) {
    Apache::Test-&gt;import();

    plan(tests =&gt; 1, have('AxKit', 'mod_perl', &amp;have_apache(1), &amp;have_lwp));

    ok(1);
} else {
    require Test::More;
    Test::More-&gt;import();

    plan(skip_all =&gt; 'Apache::Test not installed. Skipping AxKit XSP tests.');
};
</code></pre>

<p>
I used <samp>require/import</samp> instead of <samp>use</samp> because of this warning/error:
</p>
<pre><samp>main::ok() called too early to check prototype at - line 8.</samp></pre>

<p>
Why understand the problem when I can just avoid it? :-)
</p>
