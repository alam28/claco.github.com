Progress in groves. Most of this site is compliant (for lack of a better term) with the suggestions at <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/">diveintoaccessibility.org</a>. I'm still weeding my way through the Movable Type database double checking the title attributes for the anchor tags, adding acronym tags where appropriate, and adding image width and height. What a night.
</p>
<p>
Among the changes we have:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Better page titles</li>
<li>Global navigation access keys</li>
<li>Link tag relational navigation</li>
<li>Help page and accessibility statement</li>
<li>Better anchor tag title attributes</li>
<li>Acronyms where appropriate</li>

</ul>

<p>
We're getting there. And I'm up to post #105. How the hell did that happen?
