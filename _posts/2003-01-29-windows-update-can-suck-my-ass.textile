I should know better, but apparently I fell under the stupid spell this morning. The plan was simple. Get up early. Update database servers' OS. Update database server software.
Go home early. Praise Murphy, it didn't quite happen that way.
</p>
<p>
Instead, it went something like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Get up early</li>
<li>Install OS service pack</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Install IE SP1</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Install more OS patchs</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Do ANYTHING</li>
<li>Reboot (No wonder people don't update their servers)</li>
<li>Look at the server wrong</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Server hangs at startup. Fsck.</li>
<li>Spend another hour in recovery console finding bad driver.</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ol>
<p>
So much for database service packs. Maybe tomorrow. Let's not even talk about why in the hell Windblows Upchuck fed me the wrong drivers.
