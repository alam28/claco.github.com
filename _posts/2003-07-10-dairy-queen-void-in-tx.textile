I just watched a Dairy Queen commercial on TV about the new all-american blizzard: red white and blue M&amp;Ms in ice cream. Sound good. :-)
Then I noticed something strange. In the small print at the bottom of the screen:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"At participating stores only. <strong>Void in TX</strong> ..."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Huh?
Wonder if Texas has on of the strange gun-toatin-red-neck laws where you can sell things in red white and blue unless it's a flag. Hey, I've heard stranger things.
