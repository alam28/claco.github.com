Apparently while I've been tinkering with other things, LEC has <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/jediacademy/">announced a forthcoming sequel</a> to Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. Schaaaawinnnng. I'm all over that like a fly on stink when I can preorder that bad boy. There goes another couple weeks of sleep. Let's hope they tweak up the performance a little bit to closer match other Q3 engine based games.

Speaking or preordering games, I really should get a copy of The Matrix preordered since I'm sure the abilitiy to find it in a store will not be to easy when it and the movie are released.
