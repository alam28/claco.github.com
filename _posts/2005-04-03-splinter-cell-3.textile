I must say, after all the crap with the last version of Splinter Cell; the crappy patches, the crashes, the corrupt profile issues; this new version is actually great.

On top of that, it's cheap too. $30-$40. That's great compared to friggin Half-Life<sup>2</sup> and Doom<sup>3</sup> that were above $50 when they were released.

I had to turn down all the featuresto get 1920x1200 playable. Time for an X800 XT PE or X850 XT PE. I think Margo would kill me. :-)
