Well, apprently I needed a new game to go with the new video card. I saw that Splinter Cell was released for the PC so I picked it up.
I haven't installed it yet, but from reading the mini manual, it appears to have some cool moves. I never thought I'd like battle/covert ops type games, but Soldier of Fortune II seemed to change that for me.

The current list of PC games I play:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</li>
<li>The Thing</li>
<li>Soldier of Fortune II</li>
<li>Splinter Cell</li>
<li>Civilization III</li>
<li>Quake II</li>
<li>Quake (Capture The Flag)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, if I could just <em>finish</em> on of these games without cheating. :-)
