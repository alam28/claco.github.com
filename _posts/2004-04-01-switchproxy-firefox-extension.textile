<p>
Now that I've got Firefox running on my <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000471/">Iomega USB thumbdrive</a>, I stumbled across an awesome extension called <a href="http://jgillick.nettripper.com/switchproxy/">SwitchProxy</a> by Jeremy Gillick. 
</p>
<p>
It allows you to switch between multiple sets of proxy settings which is awesome since I use a proxy at home, and a proxy at work with different sets of exceptions and ports.
