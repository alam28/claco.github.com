I'm a big Lewis Black fan. On of his rants goes roughly like this: "I knew if was the end of days when I walked out of a Starbucks, looked across the street, and saw another Starbucks!".

We went and saw Shrek 2 last night and I kid you not. In one part of the movie, a giant gingerbread guy tears the large Starbuck-like cup off of the Starbuck-like building and all of the people in side scream and run out and across the street into another Starbucks-like store. Too funny.

The Far Far Away town was funny like that, they had popular-like store logos and titles like "The Olf Naverly". All in all, it was a damn funny movie.
