When I heard that Dave Matthews Band had a new CD out called "Stand Up" was out, I decided to head over the the evil Best Buy and snag a copy. Before I went to the register, I flipped the disc over and saw this [paraphrased]: "This disc does not conform to published CD standards and may not play in some CD players". AKA, "This disc is copy protected you evil customer".

So I decided to Stand Up and put the disc back and left. I'm almost inclined to send an email to DMB if there is such and address.
