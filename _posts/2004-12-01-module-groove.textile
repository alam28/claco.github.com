I'm glad I decided to take adopt a few <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~claco/">CPAN modules</a>. It's gotten me back into a groove of using source coontrol and <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?view=rev&amp;rev=109277">contributing to other projects</a>. More importantly, it's gotten me back in programming mode at home instead of just sit on my ass mode.

Along those lings, I'm thinking about an upgrade to <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> from CVS. I don't do enough major things with CVS to need to upgrade to Subversion, but I think I like Subversions anon web access better than CVS. It sucks to run a copy of Apache2 to do it, but what the hell.

Anyone out there got and experience with sharing anon CVS over the web vs. anon sharing of SVN?

Either way, at least I have TortoiseCVS and TortoiseSVN.
