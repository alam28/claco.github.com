You know the routine; more new tunes. I rarely ever buy music at FYE (Your Your Entertainment, formerly Camolot), so it came as a nice surprise to me that they have installed listenening stations in their stores. Grab a cd, scan it, here clips. Same with movies. Fuckin A. That's how it should be. It actually was helpful when picking out another <strong>Iron Maiden</strong> CD. I hate the CDs where Brice Dickenson wasn't in the bad. Listen to the samples, nope, he's not on that one. Liston to another CD, yup, there we go.

<li><strong>Tenacious D: Tenacious D</strong>

I actually found out about TD via their HBO half hour specials. If you've never heard them, it's like acoustic-hard-rock meets standup comedy.

<li><strong>Iron Maiden: No Prayer For The Dying</strong>
<p>
Same stuff. Different album. But I still like them just the same.
