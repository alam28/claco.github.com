Almost. :-) Over the last 5 weeks or so I've finally stopped saturating my body with caffine. Not Coke. No Pepsi, or Mt. Dew. I'll still drink an occasional Caffine Free Dient Coke when it apears, and if we go out to eat, I'll usually take the least horid thing I can; tea, or caffine free root bear. Considering I drink nothing but water at work, a little tea at lunch won't kill me.

During that time,  I also dropped mass consumption of french fries with my ckicken or burger at lunch. Oh how I miss those loaded cheese fries at Outback. :-) Mo Mo is actually keeping me eating veggies too which is an impressive feat.

One thing is for sure,  I don't suffer from the mid afternoon food coma at work. Always a good thing.
