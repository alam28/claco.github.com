While rebuilding a tinker/blog box at work, I decided to install MediaWiki. THat's the same wiki software that runs Wikipedia. I'm hooked.

I'm definately going to install it for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Handel">Handel</a>. I'm giving serious thought to ditching the "blog" and going with a wiki instead.
