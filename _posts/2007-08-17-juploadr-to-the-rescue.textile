<a href="http://juploadr.org/">jUploadr</a> is a must if you have a boatload of photos to get up into Flickr. Drag n Drop, batch apply tags, names, descriptions, assign to sets and upload in the background.

After about 5 days or so, I managed to get about 3000 photos <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/claco/">online</a>. Not bad. Not bad at all. Now I just need to finis updating to MovableType 4.0 and get my Flickr feeds into my blog.
