My trash company is funny. If I don't put trash out, they call me while they're holding up traffic in front of my house.

Last night it was raining and crappy. I've got 5 trash cans and had only two bags of trash (1 can worth). I had no desire to bother taking the trash to the curb in the rain.

This morning, they called me again. "This is Republic Waste Services. We noticed you didn't put any trash out this week. We'll get it all for you next week.".  As apposed to?

I wonder if there's some trash quota they need to meet and I'm throwing them off? :-)

Part of my wants to be annoyed about them calling. The other half of me is amused that they do and that they even notice or care that I have no trash.
