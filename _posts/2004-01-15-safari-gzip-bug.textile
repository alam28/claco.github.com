Someone at work noticed that the new Safari under Pather, which now has Gzip support,  throws up an error after loading and displaying pages [correctly] on this site.

Supposedly, this is a "feature" in Safari when a server doesn't sent the <samp>Content-Length:</samp> header along with the gzipped content.  After chatting with the  AxKit mail list, this is fixed in the CVS tree. I've backported a patch and installed it. Since I don't have OSX or Safari, I'll have to check it tomorrow.

Confirmed. Adding <code>Content-Length:</code> cured the Safari problem.
