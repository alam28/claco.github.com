So all damn morning, I've had the theme song from the early '80s series <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/ShowMainServlet/showid-586/">The Greatest American Hero</a> running around in my head. Over, and over, and over, and over.

Then I finally realized why. The new E3 commercial has a Jack Balck like dude singing about E3 to the tune from that theme song. Oddly enough, the actually singing voice is Jack Black.

Long live Tenacious D.
