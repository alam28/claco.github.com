I may have to abandon FeedDemon in favor of the <a href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">Sage</a> Firefox plugin.  It's lite and it's move around with me and my thumbdrive.

I know FeedDemon is workin on hookin up with Bloglines, but hey, I don't really need all that portability if I've got my thunbdrive with me now do I. :-)
