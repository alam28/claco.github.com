Boy am I really tired fighting MT on comments content.
Even after I disable ALL plugins, and turn off encoding, convertings, etc. MT STILL strips out a less than-text-greater than content even though it's NOT HTML tags:
</p>
<p>
This:
</p>
<pre>
<code>This is &lt; this and &gt; that.</code>
</pre>
<p>
becomes this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>This is that.</code>
</pre>
<p>
Yet another prime example of why to never use RegEx to filter out HTML.
I suspect this is the reason:
</p>
<pre>
<code>sub remove_html {
    my($text) = @_;
    $text =~ s!&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;!!gs;
    $text =~ s!&lt;!&amp;lt;!gs;
    $text;
}</code>
</pre>


<p>
All I want it to take a submitted comment, xml encode the CONTENT, not the tags, then add P and BR tags where appropriate. Apparently this is a tall order for multiple plugins.
</p>
<p>
Maybe it's time to roll my own using <samp>HTML::Tidy</samp> and some quick newline replacements.
