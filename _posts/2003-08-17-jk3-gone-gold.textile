Woohoo! <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/jediacademy/">Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</a> has gone gold and will be in stores September 17th! I really really want to pre-order this game just for the JK license plate, but I think I'll take my chances at the local <a href="/search/?search=Best+Buy,+Worst+Repair">Worst Buy</a> instead. Better instant gratification that way. :-)
