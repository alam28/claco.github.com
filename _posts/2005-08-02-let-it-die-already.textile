Oh for the love of all that is holy. Who in the hell thought it was a good idea to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427392/">remake</a> the 1956 movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077745/">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>; <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049366/">again</a>; for the <strong>fourth</strong> freaking time? Yes people, a fourth time. Like the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106452/">third remake</a> wasn't enough.

Unbelievable.
