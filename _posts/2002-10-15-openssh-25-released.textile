<p>
Looks like a new version just hit pavement over at <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH.com</a>. Read <a href="http://www.bsdforums.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=3756" title="OpenSSH new verison announcement">the announcement here</a>. Damn. I just got finished upgradeing and patching. Guess  I know what I'll be doing this weekend.
