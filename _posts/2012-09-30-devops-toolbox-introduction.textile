h1. Introduction

Welcome to the DevOps Toolbox, a step by step guide for the budding devops engineer who wants to enjoy the wonders of modern system configuration and management without having to become the "Server Guy".

The goal of this guide to to teach you how to start simple, slowly adding more devops building blocks, and finally ending up with a reusable toolkit for you and your coworkers.

This guide will take you from a fresh OSX 10.8.2 install all the way through cloud server creation/deployment, including:

* Prerequisite Installation (XCode, Homebrew, RVM, Ruby 1.9.3, VirtualBox)
* Setup Project Configuration
* Vagrant/Veewee Installation
* Define/Create Boxes using Vagrant
* Provision Machine Instances (locally via VirtualBox)
* MultiVM management with Web server talking to a DB server
* Configuring Machines using Chef Solo for VirtualBox
* Customize Chef Recipes for our Application
* Create/Deploy a Simple Rails Application
* Migrate Chef Solo to OpsCode/Chef Server
* SignUp/Configure RackCloud
* Provision cloud servers [re]deploy our application

While this guide assumes you are on a OSX machine, most of this guide will apply to any Unix/Linux machine with a working compiler, supported Ruby version, and supported version of VirtualBox. While RackCloud is used, the same basic concepts and steps will apply to other cloud providers, like Amazon AWS/EC2.
