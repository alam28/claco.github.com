Ever have one of those ideas that just popped into your head at 6am and you just can't shake it? I had one of those this morning. The scary part is, I think it could be done by a non-writer like me given time.

My thought was to create a Friday Five book; about 400-500 pages; covering the top 20/25 people from 20 or so categories like sports, actors, writers, politics, technology, etc. I would pick 5 questions I think everyone would like to know about famous people and get to work.

I'm not a writer. Hell, I can barely type anything other than code, and my spelling is horrible. I wouldn't know where to begin. But the fact that I <em>could</em> do it is appealing.

For those who don't know what the Friday Five is, it's a set of five questions you answer about yourself on a Friday.
