Just for giggles tonight, I disabled the notify emails from postfix about policy violations (when an open relay and such gets denied by my server), deleted all previously block spammer ip addresses form the firewalls, and tweaked SpamAssassin. Let's call it an experiment. I'm curious to see what kind of shit I get compared to what already slips through.
