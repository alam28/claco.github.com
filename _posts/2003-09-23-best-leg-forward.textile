Not that this will surprise anyone, but at least someone is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/09/23/protest.lawsuit.ap/">taking the Bush administration to task</a> for this kind of behaviour.

<p>The ACLU complaint lists several incidents where protesters were forced to assemble blocks away from where the president or vice president was speaking, while supporters of the administration's policy could hold their signs up in front of the building.
