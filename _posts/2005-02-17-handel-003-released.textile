I finally got a few release versions of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Handel&amp;mode=distribution">Handel</a> out the door complete with an assload of tests including the XSP taglib tests. I also included a small cart demo in AxKit/XSP. It's not feature complete, but it's start.

I got bored last night and decided to install <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Template-Toolkit&amp;mode=distribution">Template Toolkit 2</a> for the first time. After getting <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Apache::Template&amp;mode=distribution">Apache::Template</a> installedas well, I set about the task of writing Template::Plugins for Handel along with a sister demo site built in TT2.

As soon as I get that done I can kick version 0.04 out the door.

And of course, I need to finish/fix this damn site; at least the stylesheets...
