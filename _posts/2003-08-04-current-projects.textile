<h2>If I had a hammer...</h2>

Contained within is a list of projects I'm doomed to never start, never work on and never complete. Come to think of it, it's more like a wishlist.

<h3><a id="icantfocus">icantfocus.com</a></h3>
Location: <a href="/">/</a>

You're looking at it. This is project #1. I haven't had a 'personal' website in ages. So, not only is my attempt to rehash one, but I'm also learning a lot of new stuff when building it.

Rather than stock <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, this site involves a lot of <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XML</acronym>/<acronym title="eXtensible Stylsheet Language">XSL</acronym>/<acronym title="Cascanding Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> code, plus a little <acronym title="Practical Extraction and Reporting Language">Perl</acronym> too.

<h3><a id="panyard">panyard.com</a></h3>
Location: <a href="http://www.panyard.com/">http://www.panyard.com/</a>

Of all the sites I've managed to get myself into between '95 and the present, this one has withstood the test of time. Unfortunately, it's written in <acronym title="Active Server Pages">ASP</acronym>/<acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> Server on Windblows NT 4.0 (<acronym title="Service Pack">SP</acronym> 6,000,000). Once I get a handle on Apache/AxKit/Perl, I'm going to start converting panyard.com to the new stuff. Most of the work involved will be building the shopping cart system with AxKit and Taglibs built in Perl.
