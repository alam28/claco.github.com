I found this link via <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> to <a href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000224.html">this post by Mitch Kapor</a> about his switching to Mozilla.
</p>
<p>
All other security, browsing, and standards issues aside between IE and Mozilla based browsers, I find that as a web developer, I simply can't develop web pages using IE any more. It's to devoid of decent page information. In Mozilla-based browsers, a page info command yields me dates, time, size, forms, images, cache info, standards info, etc. With browser extensions, I can even see the full resquest/response headers, turn off stylesheets, turn off font tags, highlight tables and block elements, show form contents, and even convert form post's to get's. 
</p>
<p>
All of that makes my life as a web developer a whole lot easier than using IE. I would switch for those reasons alone, let alone less security issues, and more standards support.
