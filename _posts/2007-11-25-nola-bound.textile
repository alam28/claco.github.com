Well, vacation time is finally here. We're off to New Orleans tomorrow night: by train. Yes, train is slower, and a tad more expensive, but it's relaxing. No need to stress out at the airport to and fro. Just a picture window, a camera, and a long trip.

We're staying at the newly rebuilt Hilton Riverside, which is basically at the lower left corner of the French Quarter.  She has a conference to attend and I have a list of things I plan on eating while I'm there. A spicy food lovers paradise.
