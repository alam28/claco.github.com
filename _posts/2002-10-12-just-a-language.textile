Anymore, I'm really seeing Perl as just another language/tool/whatever.

That's down right <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=blasphemy" title="Definition of blasphemy">blasphemy</a>! J/K
I know what you mean though, although for me it's on a difference scale of sorts.

Believe it or not, I started out (after 14 years) in music. I graduated college with a BA in Music Education K-12, and a BA in Music Performance. I haven't taught a day since graduation. :-/ I immediately went into programming and never looked back. I guess I like programming because it was just like music believe it or not; all about creating something from nothing and solving problems along the way.

I find myself going in large cycles of interest. First is was music, then *cough* Windows programming, then on to Unix sysadminning and Perl programming. I imagine it's only a matter of time before I get bored enough to take up basket weaving or something. :-) Maybe it's just us Ohio boyz.
