For the longest time, I've been using <a href="http://www.mysqlfront.de/">MySQL-Front</a> 2.5. It's a frontend Admin GUI for MySQL. The original developer dropped the project for personal resons I assume, and someone else has finally picked it up!

A beta of MySQL-Front 3 is finally out! Glad to see this app hasn't died. It really is one of the best MySQL admin front ends I've used.
