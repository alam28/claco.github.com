<blockquote>By MICHAEL LIEDTKE - 1 hour ago

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Unable to topple Google Inc. on its own, Microsoft Corp. is trying to force crippled rival Yahoo Inc. into a shotgun marriage, with a wager worth nearly $42 billion that the two companies together will have a better chance of tackling the Internet search leader.</blockquote>
