I went and saw ALien vs. Predator this evening. It certainly could have been worse considering the 4 ALien movies and 2 Predator movies. But it wasn't all that bad.

We also went to see Bourne Supremacy last week. I think it was just as good as the first one in that franchise. It's not often that one can claim that about a sequel.
