As I've done for the last 4 years, today I got my flu shot at work. Do they work? Well, I haven't been horribly sick in the last 4 years, so I guess they <em>might</em> work. So, long live flu shots!

However, even though you aren't supposed to be able to get the flu from the shot, it is kicking my ass this evening. I get this feeling I'm going to feel like a corpse tomorrow morning. Flu shots suck. That is all.
