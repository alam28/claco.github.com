A while back I <a href="/blog/archives/entries/i_declare_wpa_broken.icf">ranted</a> about how XP using WPA and DHCP seemed to be a retarded combination with random locks and hags with seemily working connectivity.

Well, <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,8652639">apparently I'm not alone</a> with those problems. That thread makes for an interesting read. So far it looks like the registry hack worked for me as well. Go figure.
