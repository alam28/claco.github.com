Well, someone at work showed me one. Margeaux needs one for school. And I like playing with new toyz. So I bought her one today. Problem solved. :-)
</p>
<p>
It's a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000A1EEF/">Toshiba x750 PocketPC</a> running Windows Mobile 2003.

The price wasn't too bad all things considered. 
I went with the Toshiba because the price was good, and I here the wireless config is a lot more flexable than most of the IPAQs.  We'll see.

Now here's the sad part. The first thing I want to do with it? Use it to build and test "handheld" stylesheets for the website. Go figure.
