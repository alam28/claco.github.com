From <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/blog/?p=1138">The Gavel</a>

<blockquote>Today, the House has just approved H.Res. 982 by a vote of 223-32-1, which provides for the adoption of H.Res. 979, recommending that the House of Representatives find Harriet Miers, former White House Counsel, and Joshua Bolten, the White House Chief of Staff, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with subpoenas issued by the Judiciary Committee. These subpoenas were issued as part of the Committee's investigation into the firings of a number of United States Attorneys and matters concerning the politicization of the Justice Department. This resolution also provides for adoption of H.Res. 980 - Authorizing the Committee on the Judiciary to initiate or intervene in judicial proceedings to enforce certain subpoenas.</blockquote>

Now that the Democratic Senate has proved itself spineless, the House steps up. Finally, some contempt charges for people who don't testify. They also declinde doing anything with FISA, read Condi the riot act on WMD reports. Finally, that's what we want to see. Them not taking any more shit from this administration.
