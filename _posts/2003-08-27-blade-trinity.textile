I'm not sure whether this is a good thing or not. Apparently, they are making a 3rd installment in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0120611">Blade</a> movie series: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0359013">Blade: Trinity</a>. As in the last two, both Wesley Snipes [Blade] and Kris Kristofferson [Whistler] are on the cast list.

It's a pretty rare thing when I actually like sequals, but <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0187738">Blade II</a> was actually pretty good IMHO. So I'm slightly encouraged about #3.

We'll see. As for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0167260">LOTR: ROTK</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0242653">Matrix Revolutions</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0121766">SW: Episode III</a>
