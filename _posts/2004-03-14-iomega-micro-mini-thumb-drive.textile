I just ordered an Iomega USB Micro Mini 128MB Thumb Drive. The main goal: A portable copy of Firefox and Thunderbird with all my client SSL certs so I can get to my email and admin sites anywhere, even on other computers. This should be an interesting round of tinkering.

And yes, it is literally the size of your thumb.
