After constantly digging around for API Assembly documentation on MSDN, I decided MS needs something better.
</p>
<p>
Let's assume I don't have 2GB of VS.NET installed, or maybe I'm not even on a Windows machine [Mono]. I want to read the API docs for System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient. Currently, I can go to Google and find it. Sometimes I can even do and MSDN search and find it. But the MSDN library navigation blows in non IE browsers. Reloading whole frames sets when I just wans to select another node, etc.
</p>
<p>
So, here's my wish: Dear MSDN website crew, please create a jump point on the msdn.microsoft.com website that will toss people right where they need to go.
</p>
<p>
For example, http://msdn.microsoft.com/netapi/System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient forwards me to http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemNetSocketsTcpClientClassTopic.asp.
</p>
<p>
For that matter, have someone make an IE toolbar addin to do it and also make a Mozilla/Firefox search plugin for it. That would make my day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update: </strong> It looks like there is already a Mozilla/Firefox plugin. Bravo. That 1/3 of the way there.
</p>
