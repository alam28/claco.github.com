Now that I've wiped my laptop, and forcing my self to use RunAs a little more religously, I've decided to install Perl 5.8.3 this time around.
</p>
<p>
Much to my surprise, the ppm in 5.8.3 works much better than in 5.6.1 and I was able to install Class::DBI in a snap. Under 5.6.1, Class::Iterators and Accessor / IMDB junk threw up fits everywhere requireing manual installs via CPAN with loads of tinkering.
