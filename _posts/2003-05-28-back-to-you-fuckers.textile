Went and saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0315327">Bruce Almighty</a> this evening after a rough few days of hardware troubleshooting at work. It was pretty funny. Not as much as I expected. The best scene was the one they showed on the previews where the reporter (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Carell,%20Steven">Steven Carell</a> from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0115147">The Daily Show</a>) just started spouting jibberish uncontrollably. I think one of the funniest quotes is after Bruce has had the worst day ever, and someone else gets the job he wanted. He goes nutso <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0183505">Me, Myself, and Irene</a>: Hank style, then says in his best news reporter voice: <cite>"Back to you, Fuckers"</cite>.

While surfin IMDB for the above links, I noticed Jim Carrey is going to be making a remake of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0359950">The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</a>. Cool! I love <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0039808">the original</a>. I be the remake with Carrey is also good.
