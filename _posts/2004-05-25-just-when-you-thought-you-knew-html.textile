Ya learn something new every day. Although I didn't think so, and it plays hell with some HTML WYSIWYGs and link checkers, the following is a valid <code>src</code> and also works with <code>href</code>:
</p>
<pre><samp>
&lt;img src="//www.example.com/logo.gif" /&gt;
</samp></pre>

<p>
When on a non-https site, it loads the image from <code>http://www.example.com/logo.gif</code>. On an https secure site, it loads the image from <code>https://www.example.com/logo.gif</code>. Essentially, <code>//</code> means use the scheme part of the URI that is currently in use.
