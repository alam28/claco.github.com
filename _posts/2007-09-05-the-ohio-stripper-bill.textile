Not too long ago, Ohio passed a 'stripper bill' curtailing things like the distance between dancers and patrons, any form of contact, and halting nude dancing between midnight and 6am. That last one has me confused.

Isn't between 12am and 6am <em>exactly</em> when you want these typed of activities to happen? After curfews and all the kiddies should be indoors at home? That's why all the heavy stuff on tv is after kiddy bedtime. Seems completely backwards to me.

Aside from that, why the hell do we even need a law? If some schmoe wants to spend his money staring ad naked boobs in the middle of the morning, then so be it. Who cares otherwise. More laws that didn't need to be made.
