Someone has <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/elastic/">finally figured out a way</a> to use the more flexibile <code>ems</code> for the CSS <code>font-size</code> property and have IE not display the smaller or smallest fonts in an insanely unreadable size. Now I can ditch the <code>font-size</code> keywords, which work, but are just a little to large and small for my taste.

CSS breakage to follow...
