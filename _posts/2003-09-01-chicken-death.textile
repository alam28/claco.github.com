I'm not a great cook, and I say following recipes to the letter is for the birds. With those two things in mind give this "chicken death" a try. Guaranteed for a few hours of misery.
</p>

<ul>
<li>2 packages of Louis Rich fully cooked Southwestern chicken strips</li>
<li>1 diced white onion</li>
<li>1 diced green bell pepper</li>
<li>1 diced red bell pepper</li>
<li>2-3 diced red fresno peppers. bonus points for habaneros instead</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>franks redhot sauce</li>
</ul>

<p>
Fry it all together how you like it and melt desired cheese on top. Put sour cream, cheese on a tortilla shell, then the chicken death, then more hot sauce. </p>
<p>
Fold. Eat. Regret.
