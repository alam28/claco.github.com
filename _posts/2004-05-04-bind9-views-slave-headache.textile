<p>
It's always the stupid little things. I needed to finish an upgrade to Bind9 that I started a long time ago. I had stopped at the point that I needed to add an additional IP to the Slave DNS server so I could get "internal" and "external" views' zone files.
</p>
<p>
I spent about 2 hours banging my head against the wall trying to figure out why zones weren't transferring. See if you can spot my stupidity:
</p>



<pre>
named_enable="YES"
named_flags="-u bind -t /home/bind -c /etc/namedb/named.conf"
named_program="/home/bind9/usr/named"
</pre>



<p>
For the curious, I found the easiest direct approach to doing viewed zone transfers in <a href="http://sysadmin.oreilly.com/news/views_0501.html">Perl.com: Views in BIND 9</a>.
</p>
<p>
Good fight. Good night.
