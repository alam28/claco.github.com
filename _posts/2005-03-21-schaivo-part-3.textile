This is going around the blogs, and it's way to damn ironic.

The <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/HS/content/htm/hs.002.00.000166.00.htm">Texas Futile Care Law</a> that GW himself passed gives the hospitals the right to remove life support if the persona can't pay with now chance of recovery.

This after Tom DeLay has referred to the withdrawal of Terry Schiavo's life support as "murder".

More on that whole things <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/_/2005/03/schiavo_hudson_and_nikolouzos.php">here</a>.
