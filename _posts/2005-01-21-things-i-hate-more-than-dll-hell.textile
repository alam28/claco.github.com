I've found something that I despise even more than DLL Hell on Windows.

I'm trying to compile versions of libxml2, XML::LibXML, libxslt, XML::LibXSLT, and AxKit-1.62 on windows. It's a friggin impossible task.

I'll get libxml2 to compile, then XML::LibXML won't compile, even against a known good version in the README. I'll try another version, then libxml2 and XML::LibXML will compile, then libxslt will look for header files not in that version of libxml2.

Rinse, Lather, and Repeat. How does anyone ever get anything working in C/VC++ on Windows? Thank god for Perl of C#. No headers. No symbols. When errors occur I can actually troubleshoot them.

Grrr.
