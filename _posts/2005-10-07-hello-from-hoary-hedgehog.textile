After two days of tinkering, I finally got one of my many wireless cards working under the Ubuntu 5.2 Hoary Hedgehog Live CD.

And what took so long? THe format of the WEP key. Here's a tip for the wireless config developers: give examples! IT won't work with AABBCCDDEEFF, but it does work with AABB-CCDD-EEFF because that's what it's expecting.

Even better, put those in yourself if the user doesn't. Don't make it any more harder for the user than you have too.

Now, I think I might just wipe FreeBSD off the lappy and give a real install a try. THat would give me another test platform since I'll still have FreeBSD on the servers.

Now, I just need an iBook to complete the test farm. ;-)
