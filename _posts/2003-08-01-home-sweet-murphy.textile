So I woke up this morning at 5:45AM to the sound of a cornacopia of UPS beeping after a power failure.
Apparently a tree fell on a power linme one street over and fried about 4 transformers in the process.

<p>
I'm not to worried about the computer stuff. Just a couple of websites that will be fine once the power gets restored. 
What I do worry about is the damn sump pump in the basement. No power = wet basement. So, I drudged to the local Home Despot to finally purchase a backup sump pump, marine battery, battery fluid, schedule 40 1.5" PVC pipe, Y fitting, 2 check valves, 2 45 degree elbows, and some PVC cement.

In true St. Murphy fashion, the power came on just before I started cutting pipe. Guess I get to finish that all tomorrow.
