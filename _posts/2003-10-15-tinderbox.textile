I'm working on a multi-lingual site problem for a friend of sorts. The basic problem was how to get Apache MultiViews to remember your language preference regardless of what your browsers Accept-Language header is set to without having to alter any browser configurations. Of course you could hack some scripts and links to do the same using a redirector page, but this way the href links remain clean and simple.

<p>
With a little bit of <a href="/downloads/AcceptLanguage.pm">PerlInitHandler goodness</a> and some javascript, all is well.
</p>
<p>
Take a tinker with <a href="http://tinderbox.icantfocus.com/">the mock site</a>.
</p>
<p>
P.S.. Yes. "Tinderbox" isn't too original of a host name, but I find it funny in a code-burst-into-flames sort of way. :-)

<p>
P.S.S. I'm a loser. It really does validate. :-)
