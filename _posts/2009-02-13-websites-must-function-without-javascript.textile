Websites need to function without javascript enabled.Â  AJAX and Web 2.0 are fine tools, but don't abandon the basics. The ability to interact with a website without javascript means you can easily unit test your website just like you would your other classes and executables. Yes, I'm looking at your ASP.NET 2.0 PostBack Forms.

<pre class="brush:shell">$ curl -F "username=claco" -F "password=badpass" http://localhost/login/ | grep "login failed"</pre>
