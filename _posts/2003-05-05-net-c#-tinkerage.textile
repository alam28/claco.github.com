Well, I just spent about 3 days or so tinkering with C# and I must admit that I liked it.
I didn't realize how much I missed doing interface based programming. So far, I'd have to put C# as my second favorite language; Perl still being the first. One of the things I <em>don't</em> like about .NET/C# is that inheritance/overloading etc feels way to complicated compared to Perl's dwimish nature of OOP.
