SharpDevelop 1.0 has been <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/">released</a> into the wild.

I downloaded it and gave it a try. Overall, I like it a lot. It beats using textpad and a command line compiler. Even better, has has the three musts for me to use it:

<ul>
<li>Configurable Line Endings - I always use Unix line endings.</li>
<li>Configurable Encodings - I almost always save files UTF-8 encoded.</li>
<li>Leave my source alone - I lothe VS.NET and how it mangles code. #Develop plays nice with others.</li>
</ul>

Oh yeah, and it's Free!
