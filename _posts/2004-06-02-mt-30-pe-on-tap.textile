So I caved in an purchased MT 3.0 PE. What the hell. Why not. After past donations and two Recently Updated keys plus the current discount rate, I paid ~#24.00. Lord knows when I'll get a chance to convert my installation. I'd love to do a new install, and possibly make my site innards a little more simple.

Then again, I should still be working on that other site conversion that has yet to happen. Go figure.
