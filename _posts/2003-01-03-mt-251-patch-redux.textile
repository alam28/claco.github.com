After some email conversation with Ben, he pointed out that the <strong>MTPingInterface</strong> hack would be better
served as options in the <code>mt.cfg</code> file
instead of mucking about in the database/admin <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>. So that's what I set out to do this evening.

<p>
Without further a-mountaindew, here it is: 
</p>

<h4>MTPingInterface</h4>
<p>
	<a href="/downloads/MTPingInterface/2.51/" title="Download MTPingInterface patches">Download Files</a><br />
	I also went that extra mile or so and added <strong>MTPingProxy</strong> and <strong>MTPingNoProxy</strong> to mix. 
	This extra options allow pings to be routed through a proxy server and certain domains to bypass the proxy respectively.
</p>

On a lighter note, this is why I really like Ben and Mena and MT: They're Easy Going. Ben has been 
very helpful so far with my barrage of code questions about how parts or MT work. Kudos.
