I'm not sure how I missed <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/aspnetwhidbey_caching.asp">this incoming linkage</a> to my post about <a href="/blog/archives/entries/rss_09120rdfatom_xsl_stylesheet.icf">a RSS/RDF/Atom XSLT Stylesheet</a> from an MSDN article.

Once again proving that you can say/do/be worthless things and someone will still pay attention at unexpected moments.
