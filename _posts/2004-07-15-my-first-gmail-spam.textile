I finally got my first Gmail spam after posting my new Gmail address on June 30th. It took 16 days to get my first spam. I figured it would be a whole lot sooner. It probably would've been longer, but I recently changed the email in the footer to my Gmail account.

Oh yeah, it was a 419 Nigerian scam. Even better is the sponsored links Google spits out:

<blockquote><pre>Sponsored Links
Nigerian Properties
Buy, sell, lease or rent real estate in Nigeria online
www.nigerianproperties.com</pre></blockquote>

Ha ha.
