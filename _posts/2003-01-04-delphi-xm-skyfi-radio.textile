Look at what the s.o. <a href="http://www.xmradio.com/catalog/product_detail.jsp?id=28449&amp;type=Tuner" title="XM SKYFi Radio product details page">got me for Christmas</a>. Pretty damn cool really. $9.95 a month. Tons of channel and genres. I mostly listen to the rock and comedy channels, but occasionally I'll slip over to CNN Headline News or the classical side for a change. I bought a home kit for it and have it plugged into my sound card via line out/line in to listen to music while working at the computer.

So what did she get? Diamond and ruby earings and necklace to go with her ring. Fair trade off isn't it? :-P
