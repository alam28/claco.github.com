Writing <a href="http://www.axkit.org/wiki/view/AxKit/Apache::AxKit::Language::XSP">taglibs</a> makes my brain hurt. I'm still chugging through Yet Another Rewrite of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Handel&amp;mode=distribution">Handel</a> XSP taglib; still trying to solidify the stinking <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~claco/Handel-0.01_07/lib/AxKit/XSP/Handel/Cart.pm#TAG_HIERARCHY">tag API</a>.

I swear it's taking me more time to do this part than it took to write all the other modules and tests. Go figure. Once it's working, I need to solidify my xsp tests and figure out how to best compare expected XML output to the Apache::Test output. Static file compares maybe?
