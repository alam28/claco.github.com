<p>
I know I have too much crap to do and a house to get rid of, but I really want to start tinkering with something like <a href="http://misterhouse.sourceforge.net/">Mister House</a> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=ControlX10&amp;mode=module">these CPAN modules</a>. Home automation with a little bit of perl and a few modules. Now that I've got a new house with known good wiring, this could get to be fun.
