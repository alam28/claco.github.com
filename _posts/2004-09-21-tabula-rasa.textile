I just installed my new <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=27-152-032">DVD Writer</a> (it does dual layer discs!) and it's time to put my recently created custom XP install CD to the final test.

Reboot. Reformat. [Custom] Reinstall.

After that, some UT2K4 via DVD install.
