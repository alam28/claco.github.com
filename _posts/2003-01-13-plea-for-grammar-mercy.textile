This is a part opinion part proper grammar question for everyone. While going through the <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/" title="Guide to making your website more accessibile in 30 days"><cite>30 days to a more accessible site</cite></a> guide and making sure all my page titles are appropriate to their content, I can't seem to decide whether I like all of the words in a title proper cased or not.

<strong>About The Author</strong> looks better to me than <strong>About the author</strong> or <strong>About the Author</strong>.
<strong>Current Projects</strong> looks better to me than <strong>Current projects</strong>.
But <strong>Help and Accessibility Statement</strong> looks better to me than <strong>Help And Accessibility Statement</strong> or <strong>Help and accessibility statement</strong>.

Oh the quandary. I just want to be consistent. :-/
What do you think?
