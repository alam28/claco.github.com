Well at long last, <a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2003/01/28/" title="Opera 7 Press Release">Opera 7 has been released</a>; and it's bitten me in the ass already.
Opera 6 rendered this site pretty much ok, except for the lack of <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>. So I downloaded Opera 7 in hopes that everything would be peachy.
Much to my dismay, it appears that Opera 7 will <strong>not load external stylsheets</strong> in <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags where the <code>&lt;href&gt;</code> is a relative path. Fsck.
</p>
<p>
With this in place:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
&lt;link
     rel="Stylesheet"
     href="/style/css/screen-default-left.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
/&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>
I get jack squat, nada, nuttin, zilch.Change it to this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
&lt;link
     rel="Stylesheet"
     href="http://today.icantfocus.com/style/css/screen-default-left.css"
     type="text/css"
     media="screen"
/&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>
and everyone is rendered happy. Fsck. Same goes for any <code>@import url();</code> entries in the external CSS code. Damn it. This is frustrating.
Can any one else confirm or deny this behaviour?

Yeah, I know, my CSS files have a few typoes in them. To me, that still wouldn't fully explain why it works/failes with a full/relative url.
