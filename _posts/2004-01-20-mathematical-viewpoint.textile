	<em>This was forwarded to me at work, and I couldn't pass up putting it here.</em>

<p>
	From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this: 
	What Makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder 
	about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to 
	those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about 
	achieving 103%? What makes up 100% in life? 
</p>
<p>
	Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these 
	questions: 
</p>
<p>
	If:
</p>
<pre><samp>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z is represented as:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26.</samp></pre>

<p>
	Then:
</p>
<pre><samp>H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%</samp></pre>

<p>
	And:
</p>
<pre><samp>K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%</samp></pre>

<p>
	But:
</p>
<pre><samp>A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%</samp></pre>

<p>
	And:
</p>
<pre><samp>B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T
2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%</samp></pre>

<p>
	And, look how far ass kissing will take you.:
</p>
<pre><samp>A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%</samp></pre>

<p>
	So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that While Hard 
	work and knowledge will get you close, and, Attitude will get you there, Bullshit 
	and Ass kissing will put you over the top.
