Fox and the SuperBowl decided to read the Declaration of Independence in the pre start coverage. I find that somewhat funny given Foxs' less than stellar record of reporting the news accurately on anything that involves war/government/right losses while watching someone read bout the peoples rights to abolish a broken government, which is what we have now.
