<a href="http://www.movabletype.org/25/">MoveableType 2.5</a> has hit the streets! Check out the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/25/#about25">What's New</a> and <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtchanges.html">Changelog</a> pages for more info. Remember boys and girls, <strong>ALWAYS</strong> backup your data before attempting a software upgrade! By the grace of <a title="*  If anything can go wrong, it will" href="http://www.murphys-laws.com/murphy/murphy-laws.html" >St. Murphy</a>, both the development server and the live server upgrades were quick and painless. <acronym title="Read The Fucking Manual">RTFM</acronym>!

<h4>Update</h4>
<p>
Wow. Ben is one fast cookie. Email reply and problem fixed in less than 30 minutes. Sweet. We're still not ruling out Pilot Error(TM) though.  :-)
