<p>
For their 7 year anniversary, CNet/News.com redeisng their site. Yes, I'm a validation purist. <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.news.com%2F">It doesn't validate yet</a>. Don't put an XHTML DocType on it if it isn't. The depressing part is that most of the problem is unescaped ampersands. But there's a few nasties in there as well.
