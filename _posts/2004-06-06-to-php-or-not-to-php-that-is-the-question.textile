Now that I've upgraded to MovableType 3.0 and got all of my mod_alias/mod_rewrite magic out of the way to keep old links happy I'm debating on whether to map my .icf files (icf = i can't focus of course) to mod_php4 or not.

The music/album/preferences pages need to be rewrittin in PHP, so what the hell. What's the worst that could happen?
