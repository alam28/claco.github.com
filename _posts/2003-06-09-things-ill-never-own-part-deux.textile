For the one reader of mine who may remember...a long while ago I made a list of <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000019/">Things I'll Never Own</a>. Well, looks like I have to cross one thing off of that list: Table Saw.
</p>
<p>
We started to remodel the kitchen. Just the simple things. Tear off the wallpaper, remove the waynescoating, spackle the large holes, texture paint, final coat, new floor, and new baseboard moulding.
Well, that last one bit me in the butt. I need to rip 2, yes 2 whole pieces of moulding. So it was time to buy a small table saw. Oh well.
