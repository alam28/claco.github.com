I got curious and installed the Lynx text based browser on one of the FreeBSD boxes to take a look at this site.
It looks good as it gets with text, and it's still usable. Something not a lot of the big name site can say about themselves.
I also took a look at <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/">Brad Choate's site</a> since he just got done doing a major redesign. Same deal, looks clean and usable. Right on for standards and <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/" title="Guide to making your site more accessible to text/braile/phone readers">30 days to a more accessible web site</a>.

Congrats to Brad on the efforts. It appears there is standards compliance redesing mojo in the air this year.
