I like MovableType. It's Perl. That's a plus for me. It keep getting better, and now there's MTOS. That's where my love stops.

First, the default templates combined with one of the 5 types of formatting for entries STILL yields non compliant XHTML, even within some of the templates themselves. Publishing is still too hard in that respect. It's 2008, and I still can't just plop in a paragraph or two and have awesome auto generated XHTML.

Their "4.1 supports FastCGI" is not very good support. mt-upgrade/check/xmlrpc still don't work under FastCGI, and it's so slow under normal cgi that it's still annoying. Again, it's 2008 and it still doesn't support mod_perl under Apache2. WordPress and PHP: Just Works.
