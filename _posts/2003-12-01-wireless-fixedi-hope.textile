Well, after much head bashing I purchased a WMP11 PCI wireless NIC. Yet my network availability problems persisted, even after installing my signal booster just for giggles.

Luckily some kind aware soul pointed out the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=826942">Microsoft Wireless Update Rollup Package</a>. Of course, it's not part of the usual Windows Update process. :-)  It seems to have solved my problem. But now I'm pissed even more...why just this computer and not the PCMCIA cards on the laptops? Grrrr. Fargin wireless.
