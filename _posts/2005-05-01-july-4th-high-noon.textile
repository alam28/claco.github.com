Now that I've told my parents, I'll post it here. Only July 4th 12:00PM Margeaux and I will be getting <a href="http://www.celticgiftshop.com/shopping_admin/product_details/product.cgi?product=WED183">these</a>. We're going to be in D.C. that week with some friends and Margreaux is presenting at a nurses conference. While we're there, we decided to go ahead and get hitched. 

We were originally going to get hitched in D.C., but the licence requires a 5 day waiting period and a blood test. Get real. So we're going to pop over to Maryland which old requires a 3 day waiting period. We've got a nice spot on the bay for a couple of hours.

Let the partying begin.
