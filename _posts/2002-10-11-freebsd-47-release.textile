Woohoo! Another FreeBSD <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/4.7R/announce.html" title="FreeBSD 4.7 release announcement">release</a> hits the pavement running.This can only mean one thing here at the ranch: another geek filled weekend of compiling and pizza for all!
</p>
<p>
This is how <em>real</em> geeks have fun on the weekends:
</p>

<pre>
<kbd>
$ cvsup stable-supfile
$ cd /usr/src
$ make buildworld
$ make installworld
$ make buildkernel
$ make installkernel
$ mergemaster
</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
Now doesn't that look like fun? Who needs bars and loud music when you can have this kind of excitement!
