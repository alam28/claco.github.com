I've managed to do nothing on the list so far. Instead I've been to work twice. Once for a 5th year aniversary presentation and once for a IT lunch. Then I ordered 5 Tons of limestone to widen the drive while there is no snow on the ground. After that, I get to spread said 5 tons of limestone, and go get my oil changed and the idiot light reset. What fun.
