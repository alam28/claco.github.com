I'm not sure when it started, but I'm completly addicted to <a href="http://www.franksredhot.com/article.asp?articleid=17">Frank's RedHot
Cayenne Pepper Sauce</a>. Not too hot, but just enough kick and a good flavour.

The local pizza place sells Buffalo Chicken pizza. Instead of pizza sauce, they use [what tastes just like] Frank's RedHot, topped with diced chicken and cheese. Of course, I add some more Frank's at home when it's being consumed.

<a href="http://www.margeauxsplace.com/blog/">M</a> also makes a simple concoction on occasion: ~50% mayonnaise, ~%49.5 Frank's RedHot, and ~%.05  <a href="http://www.davesgourmet.com/">Dave's Insanity Sauce</a>. Quite potent, and sticks to everything it can on the way down [and out].
