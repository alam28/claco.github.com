After seeing the house, and sleeping on it, the stress starts to set in.  The yard in this one bugs me. Maybe it's the soggy back yard, or the gravel driveway; both fixable.
</p>
<p>
I drove by a couple other houses on the list tonight, and we're going to go see them soon. The yard on one is awesome, and the rooms are about the same plus a 1rst floor laundry room and partialy finished basement.

The second one has a huge yard, and the house as really far from the road. Like the first, it has a concrete driveway.  Four bedrooms instead of three, but they're smaller. A garden tub in the master bath. But no fireplace.
</p>
<p>
We'll know more when we see them inside. It's easy to fix a yard. It's hard to pass up a house with all hardwood floors, solid hardwood doors,  and 9' ceilings on the first floor,  and the walkout basement.

It's going to be a long tough decision.
