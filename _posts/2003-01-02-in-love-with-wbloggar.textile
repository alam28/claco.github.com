OK, I just may have to stop using the <acronym title="Movable Type">MT</acronym> administration. <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym>. I just downloaded and installed <a href="http://wbloggar.com/" title="Visit wbloggar.com">w.bloggar 3.0</a>.
I'm in love. Small. Simple. Attractive, HTML syntax coloring, and thank all that is holy, <strong> a built in spell checker</strong> for people like me you can't spell to save their lives.

Now, back to patching MT. :-D
