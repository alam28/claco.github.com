I just bought the new Dave Matthews (Not the Dave Matthews <em>Band</em>, aka it's a solo project) CD entitled <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C9ZEY/">Some Devil</a></em>, which includes a second Bonus CD, for <strong>$9.99</strong>. That's right. <strong>Nine dollars and ninety nine cents!</strong>
</p>
<p>
That is how CDs need to be priced, and the lack of a sane price is part of the reason why people will get them online instead.
