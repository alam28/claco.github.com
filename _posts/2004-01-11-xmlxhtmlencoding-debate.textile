Someone help me out here. If I'm wrong, explain it to me in another way. Maybe I'm not explaining it clearly myself. But I really don't think I'm wrong.  I don't believe that after converting line feeds to BR tags and P container tags, that the result needs to have those tags encoded. The result is a valid piece of XML by itself.
