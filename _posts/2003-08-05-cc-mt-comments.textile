I decided to tinker, so a few snippets are forthecoming.
</p>
<p>
First, I've got a few patches to allow MT to send the new comment notification to a CC: list of email addresses in addition to just the author's email. This is configurable in the MT blog preferences.
</p>

I'm also going to hack together a script that will suck in emails from a specified account and stuff their contents into the comments data for the entry specified in the subject line (assuming the email is a reply to the new comment notificaiton email).
