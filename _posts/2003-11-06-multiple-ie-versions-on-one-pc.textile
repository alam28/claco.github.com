Holy shit batman!  Someone figured out how to run multiple versions of IE side-by-side on the same machine without seperate partitions or virtual machine software! <a href="http://www.insert-title.com/web_design/?page=articles/dev/multi_IE">Check it out!</a>

Now, for the big question. Why in the fuck didn't M$ tell us how to do this sooner? Pricks. And it runs locally, sans install? "Integrated into the OS" my ass.
