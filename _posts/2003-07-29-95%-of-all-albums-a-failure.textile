So I was watching VH1's Top 200 Icons show, and this officially titled dude from Universal music or some such big name label outright said that 95% (or was it 98%) of all albums are failures.? &lt;jon stewart voice&gt;Wha!&lt;/jon stewart voice&gt;?

So how is it again that file swapping is cutting into the record companies profit so heavily when the stuff they're putting out sucks that bad?  Go figure.
