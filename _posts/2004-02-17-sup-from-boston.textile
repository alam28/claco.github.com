A big shout out from Boston, Mass. Well, Cambridge at the moment. In town for 3 days of software training, with a little drinking and eating thrown in for good mix.
</p>
<p>
Me and another from work are staying at the Royal Sonesta on Cambridge Parkway. Just had dinner at Davio's in the hotel. Had rigaton with sausage and red pepper. Damn good, but I'll pay for that later.
</p>
<p>
I think tomorrow night I'll hit the Borders across the street, grab a computer book (I couldn't find me Camel book), and grab some seafood.
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, this was the first time I've flown commercial. It wasn't so bad. Not bad at all actually considering I won't go near roller coasters. :-)
</p>

Anyone close by free for dinner tomorrow night or Wednesday?
