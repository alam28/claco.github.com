Apparantly I felt the need to waste my weekend creating a custom XP installaton CD.

While it's not perfect, it at least installs ATI, Audigy2 and wireless drivers along with .NET 1.1, .NET SP1, Firefix, Thunderbird, WMP10, Textpad and NUnit 2.2.

It's all down hill from there. I got a chuckle out of the fact that my box has an assload of network in it; 3COM GB, 3C905, MN-730 Wireless, and IP on the two firewire ports.

Also for the curious, you can find a boatload of unattended/slipstreaming information at the <a href="http://unattended.msfn.org/">Unattended XP CD</a> website.

Keep this in mind though, regardless of some of the examples, <strong>always keep all of your files in 8.3 format</strong>.
