I got tired of using a corded mouse on he MBP, so I broke down and bought a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/notebook_products/mice/devices/143">Logitech V450</a>. It's not a bad little mouse. Not too small. Small dongle.

<a href="/images/2188.1.0.jpg"><img src="/images/2188.1.0-thumb-250x166.jpg" width="250" height="166" alt="LogiechV450.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

I really wanted a Bluetooth mouse, but nobody carries them. Not Best Buy. Not Circuit City. Go figure.
