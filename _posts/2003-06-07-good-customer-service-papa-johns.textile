It's pretty rare that I'm on the receiving end of good customer service. It seems that more and more we all get the shaft, and people forget how to treat a customer like a customer instead of a burden.

Last weekend we ordered 2 pizzas and an order of cheese sticks from the local Papa Johns for delivery. When the guy arrived, they were missing one pizza. He left the one pizza and cheese sticks, without getting paid, and headed back to Papa Johns.

About 20 minutes later, the driver returned. However, instead of our missing pizzia, he returned with and entirely new order: 2 additional pizzas and another order of cheese sticks which we paid for. The first pizza and cheese stick were free. Fantastic.
