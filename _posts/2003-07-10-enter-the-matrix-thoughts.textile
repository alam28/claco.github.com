When I first got Enter The Matrix for the PC, I htought it was a so so game. THe vid performance wasn't that hot, even on an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro card. Plus, the first few leves of driving the streets, and shooting your way though the opst office weren't nothing special.

I must say though, after playing it for a while on my new game PC (more faster RAM/CPU), once you get to the sewer levels and such, it's a pretty damn fun game; if for no other reason the slo-mo shooting, slo-mo jumping and focus-choking, which turns out of course to be a swift neck-break of your enemy including sound effects. :-)
