Ok, someone clue me in.  When gas prices keep climbing, all I hear is the same old BS from the oil companies, "higher prices to import, lower quantity, higher demand equals higher prices".
Then I also here this shit on the internet about which companies to buy gas from that <em>don't</em> import oil, aka, don't support terrorism. Guess what? Gas at their stations isn't any lower then from stations that <em>do</em> import. So what the fuck? Sounds like gouging to me.

Don't even get me started on these fuckers in the Department of Transportation that want to raise gas taxes to pay for roads. And guess who's still making money in their companies on all this shit? That's right, baby George and cousin Chaney. Next it'll be these pissants selling natural gas that will drive their prices through the roof.

That is all.
