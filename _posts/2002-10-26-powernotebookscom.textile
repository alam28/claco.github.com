<p>
	Just a quick follow-up to my <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000039/" title="My review of the Sager NP5660 laptop">recent review/purchase</a> of the 
	Sager NP5660 from <a href="http://www.powernotebooks.com/" title="PowerNotebooks home page"><cite>PowerNotebooks</cite></a>.  
	Not to long after I received my new lappy, I got an email from Donald at PowerNotebooks thanking 
	me once again for my business and asking if i have any problems with it so far.
</p>
<p>
	Way cool. Stuff like that makes me a happy consumer. Did I get an email from Compaq when I bought a lappy? No. 
	From HP? No. From CompUSA? No. Getway? No. Now guess who out of those will be getting my laptop business from now on? PowerNotebooks.
