A while ago <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000196/">I mentioned</a> that my new paint job on the <a href="/images/offtopic/truck.png">big red fun toy</a> was a little sub par in on spot and a rust bubble started. I also mentioned that the place wasted not a second thought on fixing it free of charge.

Well, this week I dropped her off and picked her up this afternoon. It only cost me $130 for a new tailgate applicae.  Looks good, and it's fixed.
