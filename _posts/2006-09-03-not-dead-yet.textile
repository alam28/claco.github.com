Yes, I'm still alive. Still working. Still coding <a href="http://handelframework.com/blog/">Handel</a>. Still waiting to get started on <a href="http://handelframework.com/blog/announcements/tpf_grant_proposal_approved_mango/">Mango</a>.

And if that isn't bad enough, I managed to distract myself with a MovableType 3.32 upgrade. Damn those new Widgets! :-)

Ok. Back to Handel. Maybe I can squeeze out another version today.
