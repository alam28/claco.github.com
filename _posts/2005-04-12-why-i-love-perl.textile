I love Perl because it gets the hell out of my way. If I had a dollar for every language that made this more difficult than it had to be:

<pre>my $var = somethingelse() || 'default';</pre>

I'd be a friggin millionare. Strongly typed or not (.NET), other languages just suck at something simple like that, or even things like this:

<pre>if ($anyobjectorvariableortype) { };</pre>

Geez, I love Perl.
