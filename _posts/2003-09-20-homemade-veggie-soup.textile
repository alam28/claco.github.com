In an effort to get rid of some large quantity of sloppy joes last week, we decided to take a chance and attempt to make veggie soup. Some diced carrots, diced potatoes, corn, celery, onions, tomato sauce, beef broth and box of noodles later the deed was done. It was pretty good, although it as veggie paste the next day requiring much more water to thin it back out. No one died or went to the hospital, to it was a success.
