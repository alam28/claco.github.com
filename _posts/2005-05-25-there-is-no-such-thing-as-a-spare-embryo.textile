I've said it before, and I'll say it again. The man is an idiot. GW quoth yesterday on tv "and the children here today remind us that there is no such thing as a spare embryo".

Has he never been educated to how fertalization clinics and invetro fertalization works? They create many many "spares" in hopes that at least one implanted will be successful. THe rest are thrown away. Yes, thrown away, or "killed" in the religous rights mind. But of course, none of them are out against fertalization for people who really want children are they? Or course not.

There is no reason under the sun that those should not be used for reasearch. It is not "destroying life to save life" since they're already being disposed of.

Now, tell that loved one of yours that "sorry, while we could cure your paralysis if treated right away but we can't because of the religous nuts". It <strong>is</strong> happening oversees right now in places that aren't as screwed up as we are. There <strong>are</strong> people who have had their paralysis <strong>reversed</strong> with new treatments. It's medical fact and documented in medical journals.

This is why religon is no better than politics any more. Religon was supposed to be a agenda free. Now, it's no better than politics. Mr 51% Mandate can't leave soon enough in 2008.
