I am disappointed that the Patriots lost the perfect record, but this was a good game. and I don't even really care about football. Low Scores. Close spread. Touch defense on both sides.

This was a nail biter right up to the end. Even some of the very last hail mary passes in the last 60 seconds had a really good chance at putting the Patriots back on top. That's a good game in any book.
