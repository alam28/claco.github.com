I'm kind of pissed that the Revenge Of The Sith game isn't getting a PC version. LucasArts is sadly lacking when it comes to a Jedi-based First Person Shooter. 

Jedi Academy is long in the tooth compared to HL2 and DOOM3. Battlefront and Battlefront 2... bah. I hate Real Time Strategy games. Republic Commando...not Jedi related. I wouldn't touch Galaxies with a ten foot pole.

I sure their FPS space doesn't stay empty for too long.
