<p>
Useless feature of the evening. I've GeoURLed my site. See <a href="http://geourl.org/near/alt.html?p=http%3A%2F%2Ftoday.icantfocus.com%2F&amp;lat=&amp;lon=&amp;dist=100">what sites are within 100 miles</a> of this site. From the looks of it, we're very interested in weather in this part of the country. :-)
