No really, I do. It's damn good job. And I understand and accept that from time to time, things go wrong and I will get called at 4 in the morning. That's part of the job.

What I have a real issue with is having to guide people through the process of logging into and rebooting a server. A task that would seem to be the minimal requirement for getting their job is apparently a lost art. It is at that time at 4 in the morning that I get very very angry.
