<p>
I had the itch. I scratched. Make sure to refresh <a href="/style/css/style.css">ye olde stylesheet</a>.
</p>
<p>
Among the changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Single column layout. I got tired of wasting space just for a sidebar full of junk.</li>
<li>Archives have their <a href="/archives/">own page</a>.</li>
<li>Links have their <a href="/links/">own page</a>.</li>
<li>Nice wide layout to better spew forth code.</li>
<li>Smaller pages. Less junk.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Still plenty of stylesheet and database cleanup to do and I still need to find a good place for the RSS links.
