There's really only one thing I despise doing more than coding HTML forms, even more than writing my TDD tests first: <strong>writing TCP/Sockets programs</strong>. I love a good game of name-that-TCP-flag and find-the-FIN. Especially fun is the but-there-it-is-on-the-NIC-why-isn't-it-in-the-buffer?

Thank god for Ethereal and a good packet sniff.
