Here's a fun way to waste 2 hours of your life. I was writing a custom config section, and trying to figure out why this wasn't throwing a duplicate key error:
<!--more-->
<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;monitors&gt;
  &lt;monitor name="File" /&gt;
  &lt;monitor name="File" /&gt;
&lt;/monitors&gt;</pre>
After surfing Google endlessly, I finally found this on MSDN:
<blockquote>Note that elements with identical keys and values are not considered duplicates, and are accepted silently. Only elements with identical keys but different values are considered duplicates.</blockquote>
That was fun. :-/
