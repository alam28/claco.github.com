Grrrr. Why in the hell doesn't System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient (or the pure System.Net.Socket interface) have a ConnectTimeout option? I know. There is a SendTimeout and a ReceiveTimeout, even and the socket options level. Why is there no connection timeout? IF the remote server is offline, the connect takes forever to timeout.

Sure, I can jump through god knows how many hoops and dump the Connect into another timed thread, but  k'mon. That's silly.  Apparently the perl IO::Socket couterpart spoiled me into thinking it was something people actually wanted to change rather tha have everything grind to a halt waiting on a dead remote host. :-/
