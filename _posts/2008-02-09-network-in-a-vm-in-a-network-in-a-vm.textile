Things that make my brain hurt. I can't actually believe this works.

I have my MacBook Pro running on my internal network, which is NATed being my router, which also NATs my internet connection (That's another story). I tried the OSX Cisco VPN client, and it was less than stable so I deleted it.

Now, I have Parallels running XP. Within that XP install, I installed the Windows Cisco VPN client...and it actually works. Even more fun, while XP is VPNed into work, my OSX network is unaffected and still local. :-)
