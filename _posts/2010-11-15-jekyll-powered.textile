After a few weekends of tinkering, I finally finished converting my old old old MovableType site to "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com with the help of a quick and dirty "Perl script":https://github.com/claco/claco.github.com/blob/master/_scripts/convert.pl.

In addition to converting the old blog to Jekyll, the same script also converted the comments to InstaDebate format, one of the formats Disqus can import. Since I have a paid GitHub account, the site is hosted using GitHub Page as well. Win. Win. Win. :-)

Converted to Vim. Deleted WordPress. Deleted TextMate. Patched Jekyll. Patched Jekyll.vim. Good time had by all.
