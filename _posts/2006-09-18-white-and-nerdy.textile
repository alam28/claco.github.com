<strong>Update:</strong> The YouTube video is already gone at the copyright holders request. I hope that is the record company, and not Weird Al. When will they learn that this is free advertising. Had I not seen the video, I wouldn't have bought the CD. But now that someone is being an asshat, I'm not going to.

Here's the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6566230463793540146&q=white+nerdy">Google video</a> [for now].


The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/PFyXdrpuZrE">new Weird Al video</a> totally kicks ass. I'll be buying this album for sure.
