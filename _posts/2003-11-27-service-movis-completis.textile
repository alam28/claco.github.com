Well, in theory, everything thing is moved and DNS should be propogated quite nicely by now. The only hitch so far is the damn router that came with the DSL. It's a Cayman 3546. Not a bad router, but it's NAT suffers from one caveat I hate: I can't access internal servers via their external IP address. I used to be able to do this on my old router (Efficient 5861) just fine.

Oh well. Time to upgrade to Bind9 and use the view to send different records for my domains for internal and external clients.
