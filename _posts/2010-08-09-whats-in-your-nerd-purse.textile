We've all got one. The computer bag. The geek sack. The nerd purse. Full of mysterious wonders and trinkets. Mine got a few new additions today adde to the list of things that I almost always need at a meetup or weekend nerd camp.
<h2>Rosewill SATA/IDE 2.5/3.5 to USB Adapter</h2>
Best case scenario you need to copy and old drive to a new one to upgrade. Worst case you get the "my hard drive/computer is dead and I don't have backups" phone call from a relative. In my case, I need to wipe a lot of old hard drives securely before recycling the hardware. In any case, being able to connect darn near any IDE/SATA device to your USB port can be bad on the road.

<h2>PPA 4 Port USB Squid</h2>
While my laptop has 3 ports, by the time I slap a mouse, ipod and keyboard on that, I'm out of luck if I need to attach a drive. IF it's not me, it's someone else. Just a good all around thing to have.

<h2>Philips Retractable USB 2.0 Adapter Kit</h2>
Type A. Type B. Mini A. Mini B. Micro AB. Micro B. Lions, Tigers and Bears! Cameras. Phones. Drives. Card Readers. Only 1 cable needed and throw away the others (except for the ipod cables. Damn you Apple!).

<h2>Logitech Laser Nano 450 Mouse</h2>
Not too small for a notebook mouse. Not as bulky as a normal mouse. Scroll wheel w/side to side scroll wheel buttons. Always need a mouse, or someone else always forgets theirs.

<h2>Western Digital MyPassport</h2>
Nothing brings a nerd development weekend to a halt quicker than completely borking your system. Keep a portable drive with you. Keep Time MAchine up to date. And keep an OSX disc with you. Reinstall/retore and you're back in business.

<h2>GE In-Ear Headphones w/Inline Mic</h2>
In normal mode, you can use these to listen to your tunes and rock out some code. In crisi mode, you're phone has died and these double as a mic to use with Google/VoiP/Gizmodo.

<h2>Monster ScreenClean</h2>
A clean laptop screen is a happy laptop screen. Be the most popular person at the table.

<h2>Power Strip</h2>
I usually leave this at home except for the long weekends or crowded meetups. You can never go wrong with a power strip.
