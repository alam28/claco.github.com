Unfucking believable. Just when I thought I've heard it all. Let's <a href="http://orlando.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2003/08/25/story1.html">tax the fucking LAN</a> network (AKA, how to drive away your tech sector). Great idea. What we need is more politicians at the bottom of the sea. Tax the water pressure there, and let us know how it goes.
