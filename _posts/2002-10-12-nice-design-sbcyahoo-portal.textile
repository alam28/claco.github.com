I recently got SBC/Yahoo (A)DSL  service. Part of the package came with oodles of free Yahoo hoopla: Photo space, Briefcase, Web Mail, yadda, yadda. Stuff that I'll never use since I host my own. (Eating my own dog food again). But just for giggles, I went to the portal page for SBC/Yahoo customers and got a pleasent surprise. It looked a lot better to me than the normal Yahoo stuffs.

This is another site form the nice and clean but appealing handbook.Yet again, another site with a bogus DOCTYPE and it doesn't validate. Someday. Just maybe. :-)
