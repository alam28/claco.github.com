I need to start taking crack or something. I'm ass tired, lazy and unproductive. The truth is, I'm fat and out of shape, which I'm sure is most of my problem in the motivation department.

I spent Saturday lazin around with the woman watching tv. I spent Sunday cleanin the kitchen at her old apartment so we could start moving the rest of her stuff over to my place. And today, I ordered a new P4 2.4C processor  that should overclock a whole lot more than my 3.0C. All in all, nothing accomplished. :-)

And as usual, rather than mowing the grass, I'm surfin the net, watchin tv, and posting to my blog. Go figure.
