Ok, what the fuck is wrong with these people? This kind of stupidity really chaps my ass. Apparently a lawyer in a New York mall was arrested for not removing his "Give Peace A Chance" T-shirt that he bought in the mall. I hope these idiots get fired. Sure, the mall is 'private' property, but still.

According to the criminal complaint filed Monday, Stephen Downs was wearing a T-shirt bearing the words "Give Peace A Chance" that he had just purchased from a vendor inside the Crossgates Mall in Guilderland, New York, near Albany.
</p>
<p>
"I was in the food court with my son when I was confronted by two security guards and ordered to either take off the T-shirt or leave the mall," said Downs.
</p>
<p>
When Downs refused the security officers' orders, police from the town of Guilderland were called and he was arrested and taken away in handcuffs, charged with trespassing "in that he knowingly enter(ed) or remain(ed) unlawfully upon premises," the complaint read.
