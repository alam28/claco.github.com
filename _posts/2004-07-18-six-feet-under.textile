We went over to a friends house yesterday for some dinner and a baseball game. The baseball game turned into a movie [I, Robot], and we ended up watching the pilot of Six Feet Under.

I've never had the urge to start watching the show, maybe because I missed the beginning, but I like it. We borrowed Season 1 on DVD. I've heard Season 2 isn't so great. We'll see.
