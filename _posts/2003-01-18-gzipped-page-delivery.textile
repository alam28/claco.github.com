A sort of Heads Up! if you will. I've turned on the <code>AxGzipOutput</code> option on in <a href="http://www.axkit.org/" title="AxKit Home Page">AxKit</a> for this site. That means page should be smaller, assuming your browser supports receiving compressed pages. Let me know if any strangeness you may encounter.
