This is why I still hate ASP.NET:

<blockquote>

A page can have only one server-side Form tag.

Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code.

Exception Details: System.Web.HttpException: A page can have only one server-side Form tag.

</blockquote>

This is such a bullshit requirement. There are plenty of times where you need two forms on one page. This is especially true if the forms are seperate but some content/layout and considering that XHTML 1.0 Strict/1.1 are pissy about what can and can't be put in forms, and where form tags can happen.

With that said, ASP.NET 2.0 and the new VS.NET Web Developer Express are pretty damn cool compared to the past versions.
