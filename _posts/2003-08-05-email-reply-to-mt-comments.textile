I've been thinking about another project I'll never get finished, or started.

When someone comments to a post on an MT blog, an email containing the comment goes to me. I think it would be cool if when I replied to that email, that a copy of the reply also went into a queue where a cron job could pick up the email, find the entry id, and add my reply to the blog comments.
