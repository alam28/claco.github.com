Man there is no feeling like writing a $20,000 check and paying off your two month old car loan on a 2003 vehicle.

I sure get a good giggle out of the thought that they don't get 5 years worth of interest out of me. :-)

Lord knows what terrorist flags I've set off in the last two months by depositing $10,000+ in cash after selling the truck [<em>Yes, I did have to fill out special forms</em>] and now depositing $18,000 after selling the old house and quickly sending it out again to pay off the car.
