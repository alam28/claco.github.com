Any easy question. Why do you read my blog? Is it the diversity of topics, or some topic in particular?  Maybe it's just fun to watch me ramble on, or pitch a fit about someone or something?

Since I rarely get comments or trackbacks, I curious as to why people show up, and what they would like to see more of?
