Occasionally I'll stumble across websites that I really enjoy visually. In my effort to find some Gateway cow commercials, I noticed that they have redesigned their website since the last time I was there.

I dig it. Nice and clean. Easy to use. No flash on every page to contend with. To bad it has a bogus DOCTYPE and <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://www.gateway.com/" title="Validate gateway.com">doesn't validate</a>. Can't have it all I guess.
