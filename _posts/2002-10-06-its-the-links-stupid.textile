No, it's not the story that I find interesting. Well, I <em>do</em> find the story interesting, but it's what I always don't find at the end of these stories on news sites: No friggin links related to the topic of the story. Bastards.

So I read an article an article about some homeless guys blog. Wouldn't it be nice to read it? Sure, if I could find it from reading the story. Of course, the marvels of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Homeless+Guy+Weblog" title="Google search for the homeless blogger"><cite>Google</cite></a> will get me there quickly, but for the love of god, it's the internet. It's all about the links. So <a href="http://thehomelessguy.blogspot.com/" title="The homeless guy's blog">here ya go</a>, this one's on me. :-/
