Just for the sake of doing it, I upgraded my Ubuntu Dapper install on my laptop to Edgy Eft Beta 1. No problems really so far, and my wireless D-Link DWL-G650 card finally works. I found out that the trick to getting NetworkManager to work was to clean out the /etc/network/interfaces file complete (except for <code>lo</code> stuffs.

I also apparently have a neighbor with w WAP. :-)
