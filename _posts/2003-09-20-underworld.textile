<p>
Margeaux and I went and saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320691/">Underworld</a> last night.
I was prety good considering most of the actors aren't well known yet. It was interesting. The effects were good. The plot could have been worse.

I've paid more and gotten less, so I liked it.
