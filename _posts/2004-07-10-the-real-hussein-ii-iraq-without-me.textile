This <a href="http://www.frontsteps.com/creations/1001/89/index.php?t=1089479694">spoof</a> on Eminem's "Without Me" is way funny. Hat tip to the reader who passed this along in the comments about the first one.

Make sure and check out the first <a href="http://www.frontsteps.com/creations/1001/88/index.php?t=1089480206">first spoof</a> called The Real Hussein based on Eminem's "The Real Slim Shady".
