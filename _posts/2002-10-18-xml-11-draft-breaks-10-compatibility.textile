	From <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-962392.html" title="Article about IBM and XML 1.1"><cite>News.com</cite></a> :
</p>
<p>
	I find this news to be moderately aggrivating. Apparently, <cite>IBM</cite> wants to change the 
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xml11-20021015/#sec2.11" title="XML 1.0 Specs">newline character</a> used in XML 1.0 for the 
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xml11-20021015/" title="XML 1.1 Specs">XML 1.1 Spec</a> just so they don't have to fix their own mainframe crap, um, 
	I mean 'to benifit its customers'. This change would of course break XML 1.0 compatability. 
	As if all the XML/XSL/XSLT/XFORMS/XSchema/XPATH shit wasn't already more complicated than 
	it has to be.

	<code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;</code> to  <code>&lt;?ibm version="1.1"?&gt;</code>.
