<p>
There are a couple of RSS reader extensions for Mozilla Firebird; <a href="http://fls.moo.jp/moz/rssreader.html">RSS Reader</a>, <a href="http://aggreg8.mozdev.org/">Aggreg8</a>, and <a href="http://newsmonster.org/">NewsMonster</a>. On the first try a month or so ago Aggreg8 didn't work and NewsMonster borked my install so bad I had to reinstall Firebird. So far though, RSS Reader is rock solid, and simple without all the extras to slow it down.

I definately like having an RSS reader inside of the browser instead of the other way around.
