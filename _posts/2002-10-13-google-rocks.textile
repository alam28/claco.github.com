Gogle is an amazing thing. This site is not yet 'live', aka I still shut the servers off at night until I feel they are ready for prime time.
So that fact that Google found the time to spider my site, and that I show close to the top for something is really cool.

<p>
Now granted, that 'something' is that stupid <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~afleay/cow/" title="I'm a Cow flash movie">I'm a Cow</a> song I <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000011/" title="Post about cows">mentioned earlier</a>, but hey, I'll take it. :-)

Once again, the loser factor kicks in! I figure this out by looking at the traffic logs. I pitty the poor sap who actually finds this link, then finds that song.
It stays in your head for weeks at a time!!! Must...not...listen......to....that.........

In true St. Murphy fashion, the minute I posted this, the search results changed. Damn, they <em>ARE</em> fast over there at Google.
