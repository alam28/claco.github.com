Read the last paragraph of <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BC408959E-005A-4E93-9006-B32DCD1FCA22%7D">this article</a>:

<blockquote>
<p>
McBride added that unless more companies start licensing SCO's property, <em>he may also sue Linus Torvalds, who is credited with inventing the Linux operating system</em>, for patent infringement.
</p>
</blockquote>

Where to begin. This whole situation gets more crazy by the day. At the very least, these types of statements shows SCO's ignorance. Linux is not an operating system it's a kernel. Not to mention that Novell holds the patents on Unix, not SCO.
Maybe RMS can send them a letter to pursuade them to call it <em>GNU/Linux</em> instead. (If you get that reference, you're a geek. If not, you're safe) :-)
