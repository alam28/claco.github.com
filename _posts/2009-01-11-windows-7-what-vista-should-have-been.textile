Last night I downloaded Windows 7 Beta and installed it under Parallels 4 on my 17" MacBook Pro. It is without a doubt, better and faster than my Vista install and performs the same as, if not better than my XP install. Totall install took less than 15 minutes.

This is that Vista should have been. I pray to never get a computer with Vista on it. I can't wait to get a computer with Windows 7 on it. It's about time Microsoft.
