Todd Parish, a former reservist who completed his duty a year ago, is probably going to <a href="http://www.wral.com/news/3503822/detail.html">sue the Army</a> for being called to duty and will not go.

I completely agree with this guy. Both parties fulfilled their obligations. He is done and doesn't have to go back in my opinion. I would do exactly the same thing if I were in his shoes.

Now don't get me wrong. If this was a situation where a person on active duty fulfilled his duty and could end their service [but the government won't let people do that right now], I don't think they should be allowed to leave. I don't think they should even try to leave.

This case however is something entirely different. Of course, I don't believe in the draft either; at least not for something like IRAQ.
