Apparently, my back decided this morning that I was [as suspected] to fat and it had enough. I put one arm against the wall and went to lift my other leg up towards me to remove something stuck to the bottom of my foot when my back completely seized. I couldn't move for about 5 minutes. After that it was very slow going. I went to work anyways. I figured it was better to be miserable at work where I could get something done rather than sit at home.

Off to the doctor tomorrow afternoon. My be is on blown disc. It's been a long time coming I think.
