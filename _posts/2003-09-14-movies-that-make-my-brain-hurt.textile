<p>
While not remotely complete, listed below are a few movies that intrigue me for one reason or another.
</p>

<ul>

<li><h4><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307479/">Solaris</a></h4>
<p>
This movie seemed to get a log of bad reviews, but I liked it. Any movie that leaves me thinking and questioning things at the end can't be that bad.
</p>
</li>

<li><h4><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/">Vanilla Sky</a></h4>
<p>
I consider myself a fairly bright person considering what I do for a living. I had to watch this movie a second time to "get it".
</p>
</li>

<li>
<h4><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0120663/">Eyes Wide Shut</a></h4>
<p>
I still don't get this one. I managed to appreciate other Kubrick films, even <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/">A Clockwork Orange</a>, but this film lost me completely.
</p>
</li>


<li><h4><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0102900/">Shattered</a></h4>
<p>
The ending on this one is quite the surprise. I also like movies that keep me from guessing the correct plot ending.
</p>
</li>

</ul>
