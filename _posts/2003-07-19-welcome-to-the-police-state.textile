Please check your free speech ac the door. I got this link from the <a href="http://j-walk.com/blog/">J-Walk Blog</a>.

<a href="http://www.politechbot.com/p-04973.html">John Gilmore: I was ejected from a plane for wearing "Suspected Terrorist" button</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The steward returned with Capt. Peter Hughes.  The captain requested,
and then demanded, that I remove the button (they called it a
"badge").  He said that I would endanger the aircraft and commit a
federal crime if I did not take it off.  I told him that it was a
political statement and declined to remove it.

While I think John likes to push boundries, I couldn't agree with him more that ID checks and such at the airports is a worthless security endeavour in the context of national security and terrorism.
