My blog is in a state of disrepair like usual, while I spend more time on Catalyst and Handel. I just realized that my hack to make the MT cgi path relative completely breaks TypeKey logins, which were required to place comments. Doh!

I'm opened comments up to anyone, although they're still moderated.
