I don't think Kerry is going to make it. So much for that idea. Also, take a look at the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/ballot.measures/">State measures</a> on CNN; specifically all of the gay marriage bans. I'm shocked at those numbers. I never realized how close minded and prudish we are as a country.

You don't have to agree or support gay marriage, but for the love of Pete, please at least be smart enough to not force your religous beliefs on everyone else.
