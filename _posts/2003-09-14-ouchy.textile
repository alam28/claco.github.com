I hurt. Plain and simple. Yesterday I trimmed the weeds, put gravel in the window sills, and rounded up the fallen weeds, and applied weed killer to the driveway and sidewalks. Then I went to maso-therapy o get my back/side/front fixed. Then I went to Lowes and got more gravel and put more inthe windows sills before I crashed for the evening. Damn I'm sore.

I still have to (at least) mow the yard and install the new wood blinds i nthe kitchen. OK, I'll stop wining now.
