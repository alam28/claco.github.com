And I say "Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out" to the Netscape brand.
</p>
<p>
It's a shame those people will get laid off, but I won't miss that "Netscape" browser name that goes along with that piece of shit Nutscrape 4.x that couldn't render a web page to save it's own ass. I hope now when Joe Sixpack hears that Netscape is dead, that he'll stop using that damn 4.x browser.
</p>
<p>Nor will I miss those damn Netscape 6 and 7 suites that were just Mozilla, with 12 extra pounds of marketing and bugz added on top. Good riddence.
