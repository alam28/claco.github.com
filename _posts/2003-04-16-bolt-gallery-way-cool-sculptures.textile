I found a link to <a href="http://www.boltgallery.com/">The Bolt Gallery</a> over on the <a href="http://j-walk.com/blog/archives/030414.htm#15-04">J-Walk Blog</a>. Way cool stuff. The only thing I like more than their sculptures is the site. It's got that cool techno scifi robot thing going on, but it's still nice and clean layout wise.

I sure would like to have this <a href="http://www.boltgallery.com/sculptures/Scorpion.html">scorpion</a> walking across my desk. To bad the Add To Cart button yields this fun message:

Whoopsie.
