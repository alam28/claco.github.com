Last night, Margo and I took Andrew [the nephew] and his gf to an Indians game. It's been about 10 years since I last went to a game a Jacobs field. Our seats kicked ass. Row AA, just left of home plate. Andrew was excited that Kenny Lofton was back in Cleveland this year. He wasn't scheduled to play, but around the 8th inning they brought him in to hit with bases loaded. He got walked for a run, and and the next line drive past first base brought in another 2 runs, from 3 down to a 3 over 8-5 win with a shutout inthe top of the 9th. Great game. That was a good time.
