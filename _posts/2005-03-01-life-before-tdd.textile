How in the hell did we ever  develop software before TDD? Handel 0.10 is hitting CPAN this evening.

If it weren't for the buttload (1300+) of test checks, I'd never have more than two version is a row that worked consistantly.

Every version of so I'm gutting out code and refactoring in new features. IF it were for the test it would never work again.
