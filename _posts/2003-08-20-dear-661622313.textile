You are a fucking moron. Patch your fucking machine. Install a fucking firewall. For the last 12 hours, you have been littering my inbox with constant <em>Win32.Sobig.F</em> infected messages. You are also sending out infected messages to other servers with my email address in a forged <samp>From:</samp> header.
