After <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000111/" title="More MT Hacks: Apache::Filter">all</a> the <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000112/" title="MT Search vs. XHTML Snafu">work</a> going on <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000112/" title="Search In The House">last night</a> in getting <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Apache%3A%3AFilter&amp;mode=module" title="CPAN page for Apache::Filter">Apache::Filter</a> worked into MT, doing the same for the comments forms was pretty easy if I do say so myself.
