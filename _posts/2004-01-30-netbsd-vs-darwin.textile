<p>
I'm in the middle of converting an old ASP site to Perl/ModPerl, Apache and MySQL.
Nothing to amazing there. But now that I'm writing a lot of tests for the modules, I have this overwhelming urge to try them on a different platform.
</p>
<p>
While I'd really like to do this testing on a new dual G5, I don't think the woman will go for it before she gets her new couch for the new house. :-) However, I do have this old beige "OldWorld" G3 sitting around that hasn't been fired up in at least a year. I know it will run <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/">NetBSD</a>. And I'm <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/darwin/6.0/install.ppc.txt">pretty sure</a> it would run <a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/">Darwin</a>.
</p>
<p>
So, the real question is, which one should I pick? Both are going to be quite similiar to what I'm used to [FreeBSD].
