I found this little snippet at <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/02/09#When:12:08:33PM">Scripting News</a>

A friend told me something yesterday that I find hard to believe. He said that in Massachusetts it's against the law for insurance companies to price based on pre-existing conditions, or to even ask about them. I can't believe it. Is it true?

I hope that should be against the law everywhere. By the way, when I was in Boston and Salem Mass. a couple of times between 1991-1995, it was illegal to get tattoos also. Go figure. I ended up getting mine in Toronto, Canada instead.
