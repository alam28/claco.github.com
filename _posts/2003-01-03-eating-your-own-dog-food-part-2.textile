<p>
Well, I decided to eat my own dog food, and install the <a href="/downloads/MTPingProxy/2.51/" title="Download link for MTPingProxy patches">
<strong>MTPingProxy</strong></a> patches on the live server. The install went without a hitch. 
Once I opened up the firewall however, only the first of all pings made it out the door. Easy fix for once.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>
@LWP::Protocol::http::EXTRA_SOCK_OPTS = 
   Addr  => $localaddr,
   Reuse => 1
);
</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>Reuse => 1</code> part was the key. The <code>ip:port</code> socket from the first ping wasn't released for 
the second ping could bind to that same IP:PORT I suspect this is a scope issue with each 
<code>LWP::UserAgent</code>. This problem would've only effected people who used <code>PingInterface IP:PORT</code> 
instead of the recommnded <code>PingInterface IP</code>

Now it's time to fix my Trackback links. :-)
