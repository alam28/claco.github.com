Tijm Bray over at ongoing <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/04/17/Take-Five">mentioned</a> the old classic Dave Brubeck tune Take Five. I never heard that he didn't write it, or even play the solo. Guess I was asleep that day in college. :-)

There's a version of Take Five in the wild in which the melody is still played in 5/4b but the core tune is in 4/4. To top that off, the 4/4 part of the tune is in Reggae style. I wish I could find that recording. It's been a long time since I've heard it myself. I do have the Take Five CD though. :-)
