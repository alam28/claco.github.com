Well, after a loooong downtime, it looks like the <a href="http://www.markymoon.com/rubbercity/">RubberCity Perl Mongers</a> group may be getting back together.

Last night we met at the <a href="http://www.cafemomus.com/">Cafe' Momus</a> with our guests <a href="http://www.petdance.com/">Andy Lester (PETDANCE)</a> and <a href="http://www.petekrawczyk.com/">Pete Krawczyk (PETEK)</a>. We had a nice long discussion about TDD and Perl testing, and Andy showed off <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/ack/">ack</a>.

With any luck, I'll be putting together some slides for our next meeting to go over Handel.
