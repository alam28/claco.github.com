This may be nothing, but it may be something. I've noticed a strange pattern I think. Lately, when I post a new item to my blog, I get a new spam in my Hotmail inbox. I wonder if there are some wiseacre spammers out there scanning RSS feeds and sending email when the post is probably online. I know I'm more likely to check new emails when I've just posted something.

Of course, if no one is doing that, and it's just chance, then damn me for even thinking of the idea for them.
