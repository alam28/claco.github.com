Monday we start the loan paperwork and inspections. After that, it's all downhill until closing, which is ~November 3rd!

Then the real fun begins. Moving. Cleaning and painting the old house. And selling it. Hopefully it will go somewhat quickly. Afterall, it has a new roof and gutters/spouts (this year), new windows (4 years), waterproof basement (drains + sump + sealer) (2 years), sump pump and batter backup sump pump (this year), entirely new bathroom (2 years), repainted/trimmed/floored kitchen (this year), new stainless steel sink and disposal (this year), and central air (4 years).
