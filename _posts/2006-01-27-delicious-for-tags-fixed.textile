It looks like the Del.icio.us <samp>for:<samp> tags and the <samp>/for</samp> stuff is working again. People tag things for me and they show up right away.

Now my only complaint is that I can't delete something from my For page. Since those links are really copies of other peoples real links, they hang around until the other user deletes them. What a pain to have all that crap hanging around. Oh well.
