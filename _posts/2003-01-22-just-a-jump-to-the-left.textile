The next thing you know, we into full blown chorus of <a href="http://www.weddingvendors.com/music/lyrics/song-785.html">The Time Warp from the Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>. Shoot me now please.

I've been a musician since 5th grade. Unfortunately that means I'm even more likely to fall victim to a song. Once it gets into my brain, it stays there for a while.
Welcome to my nightmare. Another 6 hours of The Time Warp.
