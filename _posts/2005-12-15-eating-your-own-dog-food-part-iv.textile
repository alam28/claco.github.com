I've spent the last couple of weeks tinkering on a photo gallery app for Catalyst. I like Flickr, but I don't want to pay for it. I have a buttload of photos to get online, epse. wedding photos if you ask the wife. :-)

So, now that I've hit critical mass, I'm <a href="http://photos.icantfocus.com/galleries/">eating my own dog foo</a>, aka using my own software. :-)
