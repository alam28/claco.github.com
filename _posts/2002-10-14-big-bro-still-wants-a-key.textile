In his statement at the time, he said that "law enforcement remains in unanimous agreement that the continued widespread availability and increasing use of strong, non-recoverable encryption products will soon nullify our effective use of court-authorized electronic surveillance." ...
Soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, Gregg said he would introduce legislation to limit the availability of encryption without backdoors for government spying. After encountering widespread criticism, however, Gregg chose not to introduce the proposal.
