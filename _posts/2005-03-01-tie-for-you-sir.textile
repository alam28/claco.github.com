I know this is old school for hardcore Perlheads, but I just learned how to use <samp>tie</samp> in perl.

While adding a generic config reader to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search/?mode=dist&amp;query=Handel">Handel</a>, I thought it would be nice to have the native config instance work just like using <samp>Apache::ModuleConfig</samp> does when using custom directives.

<pre>my $cfg = Apache::ModuleConfig->get($r);
my $setting = $cfg->{'Setting'};</pre>

The old config reader looks in two places for configuration. When running under mod_perl, it used <samp>$r->dir_config</samp> to get things set using <samp>PerlSetVar</samp>, otherwise it looks in the regular old <samp>%ENV</samp>.

With a little <samp>tie</samp> magic and an overridden <samp>FETCH</samp> method, I now have:

<pre>my $cfg = Handel::ConfigReader->new();
my $setting = $cfg->{'Setting'};</pre>

And since it's a tied into Handel::ConfigReader, I can still use the previous method:

<pre>my $cfg = Handel::ConfigReader->new();
my $setting = $cfg->get('Setting', 'DefaultValue');</pre>

Not bad for a music guy.
