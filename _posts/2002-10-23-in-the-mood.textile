The more I look are Wired News, the more I'm getting the itch to start from scratch on thi site; again. Sure, it validates now, but it's still a bit of a pain in the ass to easily post in MovableType without breaking something, and I suck at typing.
Plus, this layout is a good start, but I want something just a little more skinnable underneath.
