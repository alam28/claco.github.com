Well, I finally broke down and installed <a href="http://www.texturizer.net/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> this evening. Very nice. I much prefer the seperation of Mozilla into Firebird and Thunderbird.

As soon as the Thumderbird themes become as plentiful as the Firebird themes, I'll be even happier, especially ORbit 3+1 and Breeze.
