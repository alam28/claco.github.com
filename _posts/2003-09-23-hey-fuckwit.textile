I have no idea what <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=scoble&amp;comment=4747">this mess</a> or <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=scoble&amp;comment=4759">this</a> is really about, but I think it's funny in a bystander sort of way. I never knew Russell hated Robert, but it sure is entertaining sometimes finding out who hates who in the weblog world.
