Leave it to Slashdot readers to bring <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=77714&amp;cid=6905081">two unrelated topics together</a> unto humor: Monty Python and SCO. That's why I like reading the comments!

NOBODY expects the SCO License Audit! Our chief weapon is suprise... surprise and fear... fear and surprise.... Our two weapons are fear and surprise... and a littany of grandiose claims in press releases.... Our *three* weapons are fear, surprise, and grandiose claims... and an almost fanatical devotion to the UNIX license.... Our *four*... no... *Amongst* our weapons.... Amongst our weaponry... are such diverse elements as fear, surprise.... I'll come in again. (Exit and exeunt)
