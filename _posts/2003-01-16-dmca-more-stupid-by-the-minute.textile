As every passes by, yet another stupid use of the <acronym title="Digital Millenium Copyright Act">DMCA</acronym> surfaces. This time, it appears that a garage door company is invoking the DMCA against a universal remote company.
Here is <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/p-04319.html">the Politech posting</a> to get you started including links to the original complaint. Welcome to the USA, where if you product can't compete because it doesn't give the consumer what they want, you can just invoke the DMCA against your competition for a better business model.
