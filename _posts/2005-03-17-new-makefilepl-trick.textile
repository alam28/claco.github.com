I knew there had to be an easy way to keep the README file updated. ANd there was.

<pre>WriteMakefile(
    NAME            => 'MyModule',
    VERSION_FROM    => 'lib/MyModule.pm',
	...
    dist => {
        PREOP => 'pod2text lib/MyModule.pm > $(DISTVNAME)/README',
    },
	...
);</pre>

Now the README gets created everytime I do a <samp>nmake dist</samp>.
