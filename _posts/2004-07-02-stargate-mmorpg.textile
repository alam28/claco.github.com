I like Star Wars games, but only the First Person Shooter kind.I hear Galaxies is addictive as hell, but I'm not really interested in trying it.

I likes Enter The Matrix too, and I here there's a Matrix MMORPG in thre works. I like the idead, but I think it would need to be too complex to be worth it compared to the movie.

Now what I would really like to see is a Stargate SG-1 based MMORPG with the stargates, DODs, known and unknow enemies; the works. I think it would be just the right level of Sci-Fi vs. reality.

But hey, that's just me.
