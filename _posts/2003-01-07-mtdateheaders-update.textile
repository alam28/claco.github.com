<p>
I've made <a href="/downloads/MTDateHeaders/" title="Download MTDateHeaders package">MTDateHeaders</a> into a <acronym title="Comprehensive Perl Acrhive Network">CPAN</acronym>-like package, imported it into <acronym title="Concurrent Versioning System">CVS</acronym> and moved it to this website finally.
I did a clean install on the test and live servers here without any problems. Now that it's a true package, I've also included the base test to check for the existance of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Date::Calc&amp;mode=module" title="Date::Calc page on CPAN">Date::Calc</a> version 5 or greater.

Still plenty left to do I'm sure. Clean up the pod docs. Figure out how to create a changelog from CVS -> Changes. Decide how to treat revisions. You know the routine.
