<p>
This is part 2 (<a href="/blog/archives/entries/000289/">part 1</a>)  to the you-know-you're-whipped when series. Rather than going to work and checking out the offroad truck show today, I instead opted, volunteerd, went along with a trip to the park formerly known as Sea World/Geauga Lake. We took the <a href="/photos/2003/sixflags/dscf0053.jpg">neicelets</a> along for the ride.  For the love of god, don't feed <a href="/photos/2003/sixflags/dscf0049.jpg">the animals</a> or they'll follow you around. :-) <a href="/photos/2003/sixflags/">Have a looksee</a>.
