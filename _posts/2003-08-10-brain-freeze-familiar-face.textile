Ever read a name or see a photo, and swear up and down you know that person but can't for the life of you remember how? I'm having one of those moments again.

<p>
I ran into <a href="http://www.brewedfreshdaily.com/2003_08_01_old.asp#106040678767805499">this post</a> over @ <a href="http://www.brewedfreshdaily.com/">Brewed Fresh Daily</a>. The guy on the left, Thomas Mulready, is the person in question. The face looks familiar. The name sounds familiar. I even got on a mailing list of his. But for the life of me, I can't put 2 and 2 together on how I know him. Strange.
