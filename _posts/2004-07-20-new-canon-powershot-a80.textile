Ok, I pulled the trigger on this problem and placed an order on Amazon for:

<ul>
<li>(1) SanDisk 512 MB CompactFlash Card - $83.99</li>
<li>(1) Canon Powershot A Series Accessory Kit for A60, A70, A75 &amp; A80 - $48.94</li>
<li>(1) Canon PowerShot A80 4MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom - $279.94</li>
</ul>

I wanted to go for the wide angle lens as well, but hey, I'll manage.
With the price I saved at Amazon vs. retail, I opted for Next Day shipping as well. What the hell.
