Where did the three day weekend go? I spent Saturday <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000317/">cleaning my office</a>. Sunday she woke to a flat tire on her car, which means I have to take her to work. After that I spen tmost of the morning and afternoon getting new tires, grocery shopping (during the hour they were doing the car), and getting junk from Home Despot.

<p>
I need to mow the yard, trim, spray weed killer, clean the garage, and put gravel in the window wells.
Didn't happen yesterday because I was tired and it rained for a while. Doesn't look like it's going to happen today either since it's raining off and on again, still, more. Maybe tomorrow.

And of course, the grill is out of gas, not that it matters in this weather. Guess we'll clean the house or something.
