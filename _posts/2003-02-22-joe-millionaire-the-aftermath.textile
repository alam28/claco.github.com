Also known as who gives a fuck. As if the show wasn't bad enough, they decided to put out a followup show already. I'm getting so sick of these reality TV shows. Someone, anyone, please find these TV execs who thing these shows are entertainment and hang them from the nearest tree. Thank you, that is all.
