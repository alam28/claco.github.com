Long story longer. My good friend Ron from $work came over yesterday to help me setup the drumset. He, and my wife always prod me that I should start playing again, and honestly it's a good form of exercise; something I need but will never do.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><a href="/images/Drums%20003.jpg" onclick="window.open('/images/Drums%20003.jpg','popup','width=2272,height=1704,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="/images/Drums 003-thumb-250x187.jpg" width="250" height="187" alt="Drums 003.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></span>

Well, the drums are setup but for the life of me I couldn't find the the power cord for the CD player for play-along sessions. Well, hey, it's the 21st century. Time to get something that I vowed to never get: an MP3 player. I'm not a big fan of the iPods, mostly because I'm just not into iTunes. I just want to drag my files over and have a go at it.

While I was at Wal-Mart, I got to look at the Samsung MP3 that I found online today. 2GB. FM. USB-stick sized and you just stick in the USB port and drag files over. It even supports Ogg. $80 later and I have one. Damn small. Damn nice. Way cool.

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img alt="l_u3_img1.jpg" src="/images/l_u3_img1.jpg" width="254" height="403" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"/></span>

Game on. Oh yeah, there are 4 mores drums to that kit that aren't even setup. :-)
