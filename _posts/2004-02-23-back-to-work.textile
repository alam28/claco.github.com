Well, I finally got home from Boston around 11:30PM Friday night. All in all, it was pretty fun. The food was great, and flying wasn't so bad either. Although I still wouldn't pay for the experience personally.

Oh yeah, Logan International Airport blows. There's crap there. Maybe Pittsburg Airport spoiled me. They really dig a great job when they last built/renovated that place. It's like a mall with gates. Very nice.
