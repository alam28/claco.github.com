I can't wait to see the results of <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0803a.shtml#apple">thie future project</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Apple Computer has contracted Mr Douglas Bowman of Stopdesign and Mr Jeffrey Zeldman of Happy Cog Studios to collaborate on a makeover of the company's well-known site. We'll be working with Messieurs Rand Hill, Douglas Vincent, and Chad Little of Apple's web design team.
