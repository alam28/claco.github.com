<p>
Anyone out there using the Eclipse IDE know how to tell it what encoding to save a file as? I almost always write my perl files and xml in UTF-8, but saving new files sometimes yields me a file saved in ANSI. Ick. It almost seems like a plug-in specific thing. I sure wish I could tell it to always create UTF-8. Kinda sucks having to create the files in something else first.
