How I do love The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Lest night he played a clip of V.P. Dick Cheney basically saying how he didn't believe the government should play a role in who can marry who. Whoops.

I love it when they find those news clips.

Last week he played a clip of Dick being interviewed by another news organization. When asked about part of the WMD report and his old quote, Dick pretty boldy said "I didn't say that. I never said that.". Then Jon plays the clip of Dick saying <em>exactly</em> the words he denied every saying. Whoops. :-)
