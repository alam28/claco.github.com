So the last week at work has been ... strange, in terms of computers acting up for no apparent reason, then fixing themselves. While a co-worker proclaims 'sunspots', my vote is on squirrels moving from machine to machine causing mayhem, It looks like the squirrels <a href="http://www.smiq.com/archives/000492.htm" title="Post about strange computer problems">are on the move</a> again. This is definately one of the strangest problems I've ever heard of. All praise St. Murphy.
