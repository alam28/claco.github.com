Everytime I read a <a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net/mt/archives/001123.php#001123">post</a> or <a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net/mt/archives/001126.php#001126">two</a> on <cite>Wil Wheatons' blog</cite>, it still wigs me out just a little.
After growing up (and STILL today) watching TNG all the time, it's strange to read the daily thoughts and such by someone who was a 'star' on one of the Star Trek series. Yes, I know they are just poeple yada yada, but still. In a way, it's cool to read his thoughts and get a feel for what kind of <strong>person</strong> he is instead just <cite>Wesley Crusher</cite>.

It's nice to see he takes people <a href="http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=316851">making fun</a> of him in stride.
