So I woke up Sunday morning to no internet connection. After some investigation, it appears that my upgrade <strong>2 weeks ago</strong> cause another PPPoE profile to be created which gave me a whole new set of IP addresses. So of course, you can't read this right now. :-)

On top of that, I find out this morning that the database used for this profile stuff is being upgraded and won't be changable until tomorrow. Damnit.

So, hello to everyone reading thos tomorrow. :-/
