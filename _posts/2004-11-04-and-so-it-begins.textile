Thank god there is no paper trail to track <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=694&amp;e=5&amp;u=/ap/voting_problems">these missing votes</a>.

<blockquote>

JACKSONVILLE, N.C. - More than 4,500 votes have been lost in one North Carolina county because officials believed a computer that stored ballots electronically could hold more data than it did. Scattered other problems may change results in races around the state.

It gets better.

<blockquote>

 Officials said 3,005 early votes were stored, but 4,530 were lost.

Now, how many times do you think this has happened?
