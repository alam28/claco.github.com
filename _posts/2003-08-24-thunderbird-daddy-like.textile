The more I use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> the more I like it, epsecially when it comes to multiple email accounts with multiple SMTP servers and settings. I still don't think that works right under Mozilla Mail, but it sure does in Thunderbird. Woot!
