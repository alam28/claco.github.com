Well another Valentine's Day come and gone. We got a room at a Radisson in Cleveland, the same one we stayed at on Christmas when we got snowed in. Dinner ws awesome. Four course meal for two:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Kick ass salad</li>
<li>Ravioli in cream tomotato sause</li>
<li>Filet Mignot, corn, onion rings</li>
<li>Cheesecake</li>
</ol>

<p>
The beef was awesome. Almost didn't need a knife. The ravioli was awesome too. All in all a good night. The next day we decided to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Science Center while we were in Cleveland.
It was coooooold on the lake. Damn cold. 0 degree wind chill. Ouch. But another good day just hanging out. It's so nice to be with someone where you just get along without trying. There's a novel idea. :-P
