Last week I sent my Sager 5660 in for repairs. It's almost 3 years old which isn't a bad life for a laptop. And with a 2.8 P4 and 1GB of ram, it's still pretty hip for a laptop. She needs a new keyboard, and the lid case replaced.

Life at home without a laptop is a bitch. I'm used to programming AND watching tv downstairs. I'm crazy like that. I need to sets of sensory input to keep me busy. Programming upstairs on the desktop isn't happening. That machine was built for gaming and there's no tv in my office. :-)

Sigh. I want my laptop back.
