This is what happens when we start making laws but lose our ability to use common sense.  I'm not saying this guy is a top notch citizen, but life for technically getting the 3rd strike...for doughnuts? That's just silly.

<a href="http://www.kget.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=cb03a15b-5bcd-4764-8dba-1b2321ebc1fb">Man facing life sentence for stealing doughnuts</a>


<blockquote>He was busted for not paying for a small package of donuts, and now he could spend the rest of his life in prison.

Friday in court, Robert Fassbender's attorney, Michael Webb, tried to get the charges dropped before having to go to trial.

But the District Attorney's Office plans to prosecute the case to the hilt, even if it means life in prison for Fassbender under California's controversial three strikes law.
