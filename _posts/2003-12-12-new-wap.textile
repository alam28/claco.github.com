After her WPC11 Linksys Wireless-B card started freaking (actually, I think it's really her OS is fubared), I purchased an Microsoft MN-820 Wireless Notebook package. It's the Wireless Notebook kit with the MN-700 router and the MN-720 PCMCIA card.

It has definately been a case of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly so far this evening. I plan on spewing forth a long review of the pros and cons of this hardware tomorrow once I awaken from my slumber.

On the upshot, it was $127, and there's another $30 MS rebate after that.
