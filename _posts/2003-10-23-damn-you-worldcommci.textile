If you've never heard about my <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000220/">Worldcom/MCI internet billing fiasko</a>, give it a read to get aquainted.
</p>
<p>
We are <strong>still</strong> getting phone calls and letters from these assholes' colleciton agency, even after getting a <strong>full credit</strong> from them in the amount they're seeking; even after getting an <strong>email and a letter stating we're being creditied and it's their billing mistake</strong>; even <strong>after sending these items to their collection agency TWICE</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>What the fuck does it take to get shit fixed. Grrrr.</strong>
