For some reason I haven't been able to get Rage Against The Machine out of my head. Maybe they've been overplaying it on XM radio or something. To curb my craving I snagged the first RATM CD and the Matrix and Matrix: Reloaded soundtracks.

Pretty good stuff.  Not as good as the Escape From L.A. soundtrack imho.
