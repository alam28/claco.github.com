<p>
Another round of changes for this site.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added page title below the site menu</li>
<li>Decreased the size the the entry titles</li>
<li>Finally got that stupid posted date closer to the entry title</li>
<li>Monthly archive links on the left of most blog pages</li>
</ul>

<p>
Still on the To Do list:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Font-size friendly style sheets</li>
<li>Printer friendly style sheets</li>
<li>Get a clue</li>
<li>RSS Feed(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let me know what you think!? It's been a looong time since I've even had a homepage!
</p>
<p>
<strong>P.S.</strong> I still say there is something strange with pings to moveabletype.org. Sometimes the screen says it's pinging even though I'm just making a spelling correction; no new entry; no Post Status change. Curious.
