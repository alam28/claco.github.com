<p>
In a case of Pilot Error(TM) vs. horrible BIOS upgrade defaults, I now have my <a href="/blog/archives/entries/000322/">CPU upgrade speed issues</a> resolved.

<p>
After the BIOS upgrade, the "external cache" (L2) option was set to "Disabled". How stupid. Resetting it to "Write-Back" solved my problems and now everything is zipping along nicely.
