Well, we finally planned it out and got our tickets ready for New Orleans the last week of December. Margo has to go for a nurses conference type thingy (technical term), so I decided to tag along. She won't step on a place without serious medication (fear of heights) and I just hate the airline industry in general. So, we're taking the train.

We have a 12 hour layover in Chicago which will be a nice chunk of time to run around town. First thing on the list: real UNO Deep Dish pizza. :-)

A nice long trip in a sleeper room with a picture window. I think it will be fun. Then of course, there's the 4 days in NOLA. Banas Foster is the top of the food list there.
