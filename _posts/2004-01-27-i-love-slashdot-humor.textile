Stan by Eminem meets Rob (CmdrTaco). Very funny. Very scary.

Slashdot's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all<br />
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all<br />
And even if I could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall<br />
It reminds me, that it's not so bad -- it's not so bad
</p>
<p>
Dear Rob, I wrote but you still ain't callin<br />
I left my email, my ICQ, and my yahoo chat at the bottom<br />
I sent two emails back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em<br />
There probably was a problem with your sendmail or somethin<br />
Sometimes I scribble email addees too sloppy when I jot 'em<br />
but anyways; fsck it, what's been up? Man how's your boxes?<br />
My boxes is linux too, I'm bout to be a compiler<br />
once I learn gcc,<br />
I'ma go on and compile for hours<br />
I read about your Palm Pilot too I'm sorry<br />
I had a friend lose his Palm over at the airport in Maradonna<br />
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan<br />
I even read all your bullshit Linux news and Microsoft's man<br />
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man<br />
I like the way you sold your ass out too, that shit was fat<br />
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,<br />
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan<br />
This is Stan
</p>
<p>
Dear Rob, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance<br />
I ain't mad - I just think it's FSCKED UP you don't answer fans<br />
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your Linux World<br />
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew<br />
That's my Senior sys admin he's only 26 years old<br />
We waited on a 9600 baud for you,<br />
four hours and you just said, "No."<br />
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fsckin idol<br />
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do<br />
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to<br />
Remember when we met in Boston - you said if I'd write you<br />
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way<br />
I never had a clue about shit either<br />
I gcc'd shit with my wife then beat her<br />
I can relate to what you're saying in your page<br />
so when I feel like rmusering I read Slashdot to begin the rage<br />
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed<br />
I even got a tattoo of slashdot across the chest<br />
Sometimes I even packet myself to see how much it floods<br />
It's like adrenaline, the DDoS is such a sudden rush of blood<br />
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it<br />
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7<br />
But she don't know you like I know you Rob, no one does<br />
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up<br />
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose<br />
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.<br />
We should be together too
</p>
<p>
Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Waste-A-Packet-On-My-Fans,<br />
this'll be the last packet I ever send your ass<br />
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?<br />
I know you got my last two emails<br />
I wrote the @ signs on 'em perfect<br />
So this is my payload I'm sending you, I hope you hear it<br />
I'm on my modem now, I'm doing 9600 baud so fear it<br />
Hey Rob, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to code?<br />
You know the song by Deep Purple or Slayer<br />
its irrelevant by playing on my linux player<br />
while I write some php scripts and play some Dragonslayer<br />
That's kinda how shit is, you coulda rescued me from drowning<br />
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downloads now, I'm drowsy<br />
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call<br />
I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall<br />
I love you Rob, we coulda been together, think about it<br />
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it<br />
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it<br />
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me<br />
See Rob {*screaming*} Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to code<br />
Hey Rob, that's my senior admin screamin from the comode<br />
but I didn't cut the power off, I just rebooted, see I ain't like you<br />
cause if rm -rf'd we'd suffer more, and then the boxes die too<br />
Well, gotta go, I'm almost BGP bridged now<br />
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this packet out?
</p>
<p>
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy<br />
You said your box is running now, how'd you like your gcc?<br />
Look, I'm really flattered you would install 7.0 Redhat<br />
and here's an autograph for your senior sys admin<br />
I wrote it on the Starter cap<br />
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you<br />
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you<br />
But what's this shit you said about you like to DDoS lamers too?<br />
I say that shit just clownin dog,<br />
c'mon - how fucked up is you?<br />
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling<br />
so heres some more Linux stories to keep your ass busy when you get down some<br />
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?<br />
I sold Slashdot for thousands so now I'm a single jetsetter<br />
I really think you and your boxes need each other<br />
or maybe you just need to treat them better<br />
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time<br />
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine<br />
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan why are you so mad?<br />
Try to understand, that Linux and MS is just grand<br />
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit<br />
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick<br />
Some dude was drunk and switched his router for a bridge<br />
and his packets were blackholed, and his DNS couldn't get digged<br />
and in the colo they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to<br />
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you<br />
Damn!
