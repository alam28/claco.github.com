Changes are afoot at ICF. MovableType 3.0 is installed. I'm also ditching AxKit for my blog and sticking with just plain olde XHTML.

I think I stop posting as often because is was just to damn complicated when something needed fixed.

I'm also changing the individual entry archive file names, so I'll have to do some mod_rewrite magic later one. All the old stuff should still be running available at this point. There's that "S" word again. :-)
