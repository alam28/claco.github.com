I've got one of those loud clickity clackity lead lined 50lb. IBM Model M keyboards at work. I love them. Best most reliable long lasting keyboard ever made in my opinion.

Not to mention that it's one that I can consistantly hit the large backspace and backslash key. Nothing pisses me off more than those keyboards now a days that has the half sized backspace and backslash keys. Grrrr.

I like it so much, I figure I'd <a href="http://www.shoppalstores.com/ibmmodelm/">buy one</a> for home while I can still find one.

Oh yeah, I snagged a Firefox polo shirt this evening while I was in the buying mood.
