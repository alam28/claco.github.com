It to the point now that a few of my Norton AntiVirus 2002/2003 installs subscriptions' are set to expire. I've heard bad things about NAV 2004; things like it has MS like activation, and that is sucks up more resource than the older versions.

So, I figure it's time to snag some new AV software. I've had bad experiences in the past with McAfee, but I hear version 7/8 is pretty good.

There's also TrendMicro and Panda. I want something that works and paying $49 for Norton AV is a retarded price anymore.

What do you use on Windows?
