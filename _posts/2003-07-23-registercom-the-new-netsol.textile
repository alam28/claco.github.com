"Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss."
</p>
<p>
Register.com is turning out to be just as bad as Network Solutions.
There's one domain name I have [mjmcpherson.com] that was paid in full for 3 years, AND on auto-renew.
Yet, one of Register.com's resellers keeps selling the domain name away from me.
The whois contact information is someone else, but the DNS information is still me.
</p>
<p>
The last time this happened, they clearly found my invoice where I was paid in full for years, yet couldn't explain the snafu. After a phone call it got corrected.
</p>
<p>
Now of course, it's gone missing again. More waste of my time on the phone tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
To make matters more fun, here's the dates in whois:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Created on............: Wed, Sep 20, 2000<br />
      Expires on............: Mon, Sep 20, 2004<br />
      Record last updated on: Wed, Sep 20, 2000<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's right. The record hasn't been changed since Sept 20, 2000. Yet it disappeared sometime this year again. #$%$#
