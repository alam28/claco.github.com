A few batches of udates to <a href="http://github.com/claco/csvdatareader/">CsvDataReader</a> this week. I added support for schema.ini files including all of the TabDelimited, CsvDelimited, FixedLength and Delimited(*) formats. I also added support and tests for using Streams.

Bugs and maybe some option flags not withstanding, I think its done for now.
