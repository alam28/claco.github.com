I've recently found myself wishing that every application I use have the Firefox Find Bar (CTRL+F) within it. I think that find bar kicks ass when trying to find things within web pages and XML documents I'm viewing. I find myself using Textpad and hitting CTRL+F hoping for a find bar. It certainly is a lot better and less intrusive than a damn popup find box withint applications. I think Office could stand to learn the find bar trick too.

The Firefox team could make the find bar even better by searching the content of the page AND the content of the text/input boxes in the page.
