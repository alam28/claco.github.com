I'm trying to wrap my brain around <acronym title="Concurrent Versioning System">CVS</acronym> usage so I could properly prepare for a serious revision to the site. Revisions, Tags, and Branches! Oh My!
The daily check in/out of modules is no biggie, but when it comes to branching and tagging, my brain hurts, even with the handy dandy <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cvspr/">CVS Pocket Reference</a>.

Does any one know the easiest we to convert CVS logs into Changes or Changelog files?
