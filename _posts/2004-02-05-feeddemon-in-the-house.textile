I decided today that I'm spending way to much time at work keeping up with the latest news, hacks, patches, and software. So I decided to buy a copy of <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/">FeedDemon</a>.
</p>
<p>
I've said it before and I'll say it again. Nick has a great talent for making  software visually appealing, flexible with many options, and functional; all in the same program. That's quite a talent in a pool of over complicated, ugly, unusable pieces of software.</p>
<p>
I do find the software activation annoying at best, but I don't mind. Why? 
Because the software has a practical license: I  can use if on ANY machine I own. Now, if Microsoft would just learn that lesson, I'd hate them, and $500 Office a little less.
