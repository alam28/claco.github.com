So, it's December already, and I have to cram in my unused vacation. I'll have a 4 day weekend this week, a 4 day weekend next week, a 5 day weekend the week after, and another 4 day weekend after that.

<p>
Now the real question is, what do I want to do with that time?
I've still got a huose to paint and get rid of. I've got a website to convert. And I've got a whole lot of games I haven't played in a while. Care to place any bets?

I wouldn't mind tossing a weblog redesign in there as well, althoug that means getting kozy with DocBook first.
