The older I get, the more fed up I get with our current government. This also means my urge to vote has changed and the sites I read are more or less political-action centric.

Here's what I read now a days in between tech sites:

* [The Gavel](http://www.speaker.gov/blog/)
* [Crooks & Liars](http://crooksandliars.com/)
* [Daily Kos](http://dailykos.com/)
* [TPM Muckraker](http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/)
* [Reddit](http://reddit.com/)
* [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/)

The first four are what I think are some of the best sources or real news, now that shit that FOX molests and twists and claims is news.
