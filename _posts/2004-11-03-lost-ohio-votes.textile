It's things like this that make people wonder. Mom just told me that the local newspaper said one of the recent tax issues was passed with xxx for and 0 against. Zero against. She said she knows at least five people who voted against it.

That kind of makes you wander how many times this happens and how many votes are lost. Now multiple that thought with electronic votings machines with no paper trail.
