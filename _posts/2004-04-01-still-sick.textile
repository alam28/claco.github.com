I've went crazy sick since early Tuesday morning. Going to the bathroom every 20 minutes or so. Fevers. The works sans throwing up. Finally today I cought somewhat of a break. The fevers gone. Bathroom breaks are almost normal. But it still feels like someone is punching me in the gut.

To make matters worse, now Margeaux has caught it (which at least rules out food poisoning). She's so cute. She still attempts to take care of me even though she's the really sick one now. That's love.
